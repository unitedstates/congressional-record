                       WORLD FOOD DAY RECOGNITION

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 16, 2013

  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to on behalf of 
millions of children and families worldwide in danger of starvation.
  Each year, malnourishment accounts for almost half of the 6.9 million 
deaths among children under the age of five. The first 1,000 days 
between the start of a woman's pregnancy and her child's second 
birthday are critical to the long term survival of these children. As 
we recognize World Food Day today, we must do more to support ending 
maternal and child malnutrition.
  That's why I introduced H. Res. 254 with my colleague, Representative 
Mario Diaz-Balart. This resolution raises awareness of the critical 
1,000-day window and encourages relevant federal agencies to better 
coordinate and track nutrition outcomes.
  As a mother, it pains me to think of a child dying because he or she 
doesn't have enough food to eat, especially when our planet produces 
enough food to feed every man, woman, and child.
  I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring H. Res. 254 and give 
a voice to the millions of vulnerable and hungry children around the 
world.
