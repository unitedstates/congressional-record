          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Mr. CORNYN:
  S. 1895. A bill to establish a commission to examine the United 
States monetary policy, evaluate alternative monetary regimes, and 
recommend a course for monetary policy going forward; to the Committee 
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of 
the bill be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be 
printed in the Record, as follows:

                                S. 1895

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Centennial Monetary 
     Commission Act of 2013''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) The Constitution endows Congress with the power ``to 
     coin money, regulate the value thereof''.
       (2) Following the financial crisis known as the Panic of 
     1907, Congress established the

[[Page S29]]

     National Monetary Commission to provide recommendations for 
     the reform of the financial and monetary systems of the 
     United States.
       (3) Incorporating several of the recommendations of the 
     National Monetary Commission, Congress created the Federal 
     Reserve System in 1913. As currently organized, the Federal 
     Reserve System consists of the Board of Governors in 
     Washington, District of Columbia, and the Federal Reserve 
     Banks organized into 12 districts around the United States. 
     The stockholders of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks include 
     national and certain state-chartered commercial banks, which 
     operate on a fractional reserve basis.
       (4) Originally, Congress gave the Federal Reserve a 
     monetary mandate to provide an elastic currency, within the 
     context of a gold standard, in response to seasonal 
     fluctuations in the demand for currency.
       (5) Congress also gave the Federal Reserve a financial 
     stability mandate to serve as the lender of last resort to 
     solvent but illiquid banks during a financial crisis.
       (6) In 1977, Congress changed the monetary mandate of the 
     Federal Reserve to a dual mandate for maximum employment and 
     stable prices.
       (7) Empirical studies and historical evidence, both within 
     the United States and in other countries, demonstrate that 
     price stability is desirable because both inflation and 
     deflation damage the economy.
       (8) The economic challenge of recent years--most notably 
     the bursting of the housing bubble, the financial crisis of 
     2008, and the ensuing anemic recovery--have occurred at great 
     cost in terms of lost jobs and output.
       (9) Policymakers are reexamining the structure and 
     functioning of financial institutions and markets to 
     determine what, if any, changes need to be made to place the 
     financial system on a stronger, more sustainable path going 
     forward.
       (10) The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary actions in 
     response to the recent economic challenges.
       (11) The Federal Open Market Committee has engaged in 
     multiple rounds of quantitative easing, providing 
     unprecedented liquidity to financial markets, while 
     committing to holding short-term interest rates low for a 
     seemingly indefinite period, and pursuing a policy of credit 
     allocation by purchasing Federal agency debt and mortgage-
     backed securities.
       (12) In the wake of the recent extraordinary actions of the 
     Federal Reserve, Congress--consistent with its constitutional 
     responsibilities and as it has done periodically throughout 
     the history of the United States--has once again renewed its 
     examination of monetary policy.
       (13) Central in such examination has been a renewed look at 
     what is the most proper mandate for the Federal Reserve to 
     conduct monetary policy in the 21st century.

     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.

       There is established a commission to be known as the 
     ``Centennial Monetary Commission'' (in this Act referred to 
     as the ``Commission'').

       (1) examine how United States monetary policy since the

     States economy in terms of output, employment, prices, and 
     financial stability over time;
       (2) evaluate various operational regimes under which the 
     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 
     Federal Open Market Committee may conduct monetary policy in 
     terms achieving the maximum sustainable level of output and 
     employment and price stability over the long term, 
     including--
       (A) discretion in determining monetary policy without an 
     operational regime;

       (F) the gold standard; and
       (3) recommend a course for United States monetary policy 
     going forward, including--
