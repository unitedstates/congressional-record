                              VERLIE DOING

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to honor one of the pillars of 
my hometown, Searchlight, NV--Mrs. Verlie Doing. Saturday, July 23, 
2005 will be designated Verlie Doing Day, and it could not go to a more 
deserving or influential person.
  Searchlight has never been the same since Verlie came to town in 1968 
to help her late husband run Sandy's Casino. They built the Searchlight 
Nugget, which Verlie still owns. Verlie is a proud Texan, but she 
quickly adopted the citizens of Searchlight and put down lasting roots 
in the community that will benefit many generations to come.
  For years, Searchlight did not have a senior center; so Verlie 
donated a building for the Searchlight Senior Citizen's Center. 
Searchlight did not have a church, so Verlie helped found the 
Searchlight Community Church, where she plays the organ every Sunday. 
Searchlight did not have a modern

park so Verlie established Searchlight Park, equipped with a new 
playground, grills, and picnic areas for the town.
  These are a few of many visible contributions that Verlie made to the 
community, but Verlie's most important contributions exist outside of 
the public eye. She never asks for recognition and she does not draw 
attention to her actions, but her charity touches every person in need.
  ``She's always doing something for someone,'' said long time friend 
Marion Young. ``Verlie has a kindness for everyone and she'll never let 
someone go down the road hungry.''
  Much of Verlie's philanthropy occurs behind the scenes, but her 
impact is felt throughout Searchlight. Each year, Verlie furnishes ice 
cream for ice cream socials. She has always supported the local police 
department, allowing the Searchlight Police to have Police Officer's 
Night Out. Verlie also provides a steak dinner annually for our 
firefighters and medical workers. Local children at the elementary 
school are treated to hamburgers at the Nugget for good grades. Anyone 
in need always comes to Verlie first, and she never turns them away.
  Verlie means a lot to me personally. After my father's passing, 
Verlie was a close friend to my mother. She would take her to Las Vegas 
to shop, and looked after her because my mother lived in Searchlight 
alone. Her thoughtfulness and compassion helped my mother make it 
through tough and trying times. I will never be able to repay her 
kindness to my mother.
  Verlie understands the importance of community. Her philanthropy--
both visible and invisible--has made Searchlight the town it is today. 
Verlie Doing has touched every life in Searchlight, including my own, 
and I know that she has changed each life for the better.
  Congratulations, Verlie. I am proud to honor an authentic Searchlight 
hero.
