                           AMERICA'S WORKING

  (Mr. PRICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in spite of all of what the 
pessimists have said, and regardless of what the mainstream media 
reports, the economy has greatly improved.
  The facts are plain and simple. Our Nation is producing more, and our 
government is spending less. The estimated Federal budget deficit is 
$94 billion less than the earlier prediction, and we have had 14 
consecutive quarters of economic growth.
  House Republicans have faith in America's ability to grow our 
economy, and we look to the future with confidence. Our job in Congress 
is to hold the line on spending. And the unemployment rate has fallen 
to 5 percent, the lowest since September 2001, with nearly 4 million 
new jobs created in the last 2 years alone.
  Sustained job growth, falling deficits, low interest rates and a 
booming housing market: America's economy is robust and getting 
stronger.
  With fiscal responsibility and passing pro-growth bills, including 
the death tax repeal and legal reform, we continue to show our 
commitment to growing America's economy. But there is still work to do. 
I am hopeful that Congress will approve the highway and energy bills 
which will add new jobs to the economy, help improve our roadways, and 
decrease our dependence on foreign oil.
