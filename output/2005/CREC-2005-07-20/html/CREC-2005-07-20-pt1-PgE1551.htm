                          HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Brenda E. 
Pillors on behalf of Ms. Fredette West.
  Mr. Speaker, on June 12, 2005, God's whisper to ``come home'' came to 
Brenda Pillors (Chief of Staff to Congressman Ed Towns), our sister in 
service and life on the frontlines in the battles and opportunities to 
improve life and health for all.
  It is with honor that I present this special tribute in memory of our 
outstanding colleague and dear friend, Brenda. Today, July 20th marks 
what would have been a celebration of Brenda's earthly birthday. 
Colleagues, family and friends know that Brenda did so much to improve 
the quality of life for all people.
  Brenda developed health policy and legislation that positively 
impacted public health domestically and internationally. Her expertise 
and outstanding contributions abound in the area of eliminating health 
disparities among communities of color, women and children, as well as 
the indigent and marginalized in society. She tirelessly worked on a 
broad range of social policy issues including Medicare and Medicaid, 
healthcare reform, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, obesity, sickle cell disease, 
cancer, heart disease, clinical life trials, bioengineering, health 
technology, alternative medicine, behavioral health, workforce 
diversity, and affirmative action. Likewise, she worked collaboratively 
with various health commissions, agencies, advisory councils, and 
programs including NIH, FDA, SAMHSA, CDC, HRSA, AHRQ, OMH, OCR, 10M, 
and the National Health Service Corps.
  Brenda Pillors was always present to advocate on a range of public 
health issues from pharmacology, immunology, vaccines, hospitals and 
community health centers, men's health, environmental health, 
nutrition, birth defects, the uninsured and underinsured, to urban and 
rural health, infant mortality, head start, mental health, primary care 
practitioners and community health workers, researchers, private and 
public sector officials, and on behalf of everyday citizens like you 
and me. Her presence and tremendous heart still have far-reaching 
impact.
  We will always remember you Brenda. Your dedication, commitment, 
leadership, expertise, understanding, voice, smile, and laughter will 
forever live in our hearts. Brenda Pillors was a true leader in the 
area of public service and an exemplary servant in God's army of love.
  My ``sister'' we'll miss you always. Your legacy of achievements is 
written in the hearts of those you touched. Your presence and legacy is 
embedded in the walls and along the halls of the U.S. Congress, and is 
also written throughout the Congressional Record and in legislation, 
Congressional hearing questions, transcripts, committee, conference, 
and agency reports.
  Brenda truly lived a purpose driven life. Thousands of lives have 
been improved and saved because of her life's works. The majority of 
the people who have and will benefit from her work will never know her. 
The lives and bright futures of generations to come will benefit from 
her work. We have always been proud of Brenda.
  Dear Brenda, we thank, salute, and honor you. Our ``sister in 
service'' who endeavored throughout her life to ensure justice and 
equality for all--Brenda Pillors, PhD.
  Mr. Speaker, on this day that would have marked Brenda's 53rd 
birthday we reflect on our love, appreciation and respect for Brenda 
Pillors. We thank God and her family for sharing her with the nation, 
the world and us.
