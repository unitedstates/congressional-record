                    EMINENT DOMAIN AND SUPREME COURT

  (Mr. GINGREY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation I 
have introduced to protect ordinary American citizens from tax abuse at 
the hands of our government. I was shocked when the United States 
Supreme Court ruled last month that governments could take private 
homes, businesses and churches and turn them over to land developers in 
the name of tax revenue.
  My bill, the Eminent Domain Tax Relief Act, would prevent the 
government from adding insult to this injury. It would eliminate the 
capital gains tax that an individual has to pay on the money he 
receives for his condemned property. Eminent domain abuse on its own is 
intolerable. But taxing those who lose their property is even more 
deplorable. There is no excuse for making a person pay capital gains 
tax on something she did not want to sell in the first place.
  Mr. Speaker, my legislation says this: No taxation on government 
condemnation. I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
join me in supporting this bill.
