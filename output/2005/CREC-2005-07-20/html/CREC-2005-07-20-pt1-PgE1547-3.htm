 RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT IN POLAND

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                           HON. RAHM EMANUEL

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 18, 2005

  Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of 
H. Res. 328, and I rise on behalf of the more than 111,000 of my 
constituents who are of Polish descent to recognize the 25th 
anniversary of the workers' strikes in Poland in 1980. These strikes 
pressured the government to recognize the Solidarity Trade Union and, 
eventually, to enact fundamental changes in the government in Poland. 
It is my privilege to join with Poland, friends of Poland and people of 
Polish descent around the world in honoring this historic date.
  The summer of 1980 was a turbulent time in Poland. Soviet domination 
resulted not only in political oppression but in deep economic crisis. 
In response to these conditions, workers were striking in several 
cities across the country. In 1979, the visit by Pope John II added to 
the hope and desire of all Polish people for change and demonstrated 
the possibility of mass independent movements.
  The Independent and Self-Governing Solidarity Trade Union was 
established as a result of the Gdansk Accords signed on August 31, 1980 
between striking workers and the communist government. In this 
agreement the government conceded to striking workers' requests and 
allowed them to form free trade unions, independent from the government 
and communist party, an unprecedented situation under the Iron Curtain.
  By signing the accords the communist government hoped to appease 
workers while entrenching their power. To the government's great 
disappointment, the Solidarity Trade Union grew rapidly. By 1981, 
Solidarity boasted an unparalleled membership of nearly 10 million 
workers or more than a half of the Polish labor force and almost one 
third of the entire population. Employees from all sectors of economy 
and positions joined en masse, including workers, professionals, 
intellectuals, students and members of political opposition. The 
Solidarity Trade Union became a huge social and political movement, 
representing the Polish nation's aspirations for freedom, democracy and 
better living conditions after more than thirty-five years of communism 
and Soviet control.

  However, the road to freedom was not easy. Seeing how popular and 
powerful the union was becoming, the communist government of Poland 
imposed Martial Law in 1981, followed by persecution, imprisonment and 
forced emigration of many Solidarity members, including Lech Walesa. 
Nonetheless, the banned Solidarity Trade Union kept aggravating both 
within Poland and abroad with the instrumental support of Pope John 
Paul II.
  In 1989, the will of millions prevailed: the communist government 
gave in and held talks with the Solidarity Trade Union. These ``round 
table negotiations'' resulted in free elections to the National 
Assembly, won almost completely by candidates supported by the 
Solidarity Trade Union. Subsequently, the noncommunist prime minister 
was elected later that year, and in 1990, Lech Walesa, a former worker-
electrician and the leader of the Solidarity Trade Union who had been 
instrumental in workers' strikes of 1980 and in the Gdansk Accords, 
became the first elected president of the newly non-communist Poland. 
Communism was peacefully overthrown.
  Within a year, following the Polish example, the regimes in the Czech 
Republic, Hungary and East Germany had fallen. By 1991, communism was 
overthrown throughout Europe thanks to the inspiration of the 
Solidarity Trade Union.
  With its long and rich history and traditions, Poland regained its 
rightful place among free and independent nations, first as a 
contributing partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, 
and last year, as a full member of the European Union. Today, Poland

continues to be our staunch ally and steadfast friend in Europe in our 
fight against terrorism.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my 111,000 Polish American constituents, I 
am honored to recognize this important anniversary and honor the events 
in Poland 25 years ago that helped restore freedom and democracy in 
Poland and throughout Europe.
