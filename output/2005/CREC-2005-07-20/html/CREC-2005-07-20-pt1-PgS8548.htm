                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES


              Tribute to Private First Class Eric P. Woods

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to salute an extraordinary 
native Iowan who has fallen in service to his country in support of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. PFC Eric P. Woods, of the 2nd Squadron, 3rd 
Armored Cavalry Regiment, died on the 9th day of July, 2005, in Tal 
Afar, Iraq, due to injuries sustained when an explosive device 
detonated under his vehicle. Woods, a combat medic was killed en route 
to aid an injured soldier. My prayers go out to his wife Jamie, his 3-
year-old son Eric Scott, his parents Charles and Janis Woods, and his 
many other friends and family.
  Eric Woods grew up in Urbandale, IA, and was an active member in the 
youth group at Westchester Evangelical Free Church. At Urbandale High 
School he wrestled and played football and baseball before graduating 
in 1997. While attending Iowa State University, he became manager of 
Krause Gentle Company. After a move to Omaha, Eric became a medic in 
the U.S. Army.
  Private First Class Woods was a truly thoughtful soldier, requesting 
packages from home containing soccer balls, candy, and toys to give out 
to the children of Iraq. He will be remembered not only for his 
sacrifice for freedom but also the way in which he served, giving his 
life on the way to help an injured fellow soldier. Recently, his pastor 
said of Eric: ``His motto was to charge, not retreat. He squeezed the 
most out of life.'' Again my thoughts and prayers are with his family 
and friends. I ask my colleagues in the Senate and all Americans to 
remember with gratitude and admiration this courageous Iowan, PFC Eric 
P. Woods.
