                  JUDGE JOHN ROBERTS: EXCELLENT CHOICE

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, last night, the President of the 
United States nominated Judge John Roberts, Jr. to be the next 
Associate Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States. I applaud 
his choice, and I am hopeful that he is confirmed before the Supreme 
Court begins its term on October 3.

[[Page H6176]]

  Judge John Roberts has the keen intellect, the impartiality and 
temperament, sound legal judgment, and highest integrity necessary for 
a Supreme Court Justice. He rules based on the application of existing 
laws and specific facts of the cases before him, rather than making new 
laws or creating new policies based on personal opinion.
  It is not surprising that the National Journal has said of John 
Roberts that he seems to be a good bet to be the kind of judge we 
should all want to have; all of us, that is, who are looking less for 
congenial ideologues than for professionals committed to the impartial 
application of the law.
  But Judge Roberts is not new to the confirmation process. In fact, he 
was reported favorably out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote 
of 16 to 3, and then confirmed by the Senate for the D.C. Circuit Court 
of Appeals by unanimous consent. Clearly, Judge Roberts will make an 
excellent jurist, and I urge the Senate to move quickly with the 
confirmation process.
