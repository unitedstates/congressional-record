                                DR-CAFTA

  (Ms. HARRIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our colleagues to 
pass the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement, or 
DR-CAFTA, when it comes before the House. DR-CAFTA is vital to our 
Nation's economic competitiveness in today's global marketplace and 
will serve as an economic engine for driving growth and economic 
opportunity in the United States and Central America.
  In Florida, the Nation's gateway for trade with Central America, we 
recognize the importance of this regional bloc. The DR-CAFTA countries 
represent our State's largest export market and the second largest 
United States market in Latin America. By lowering trade barriers, we 
can expand this market even further. That is good news for Florida 
businesses, good news for Florida agricultural products, and good news 
for Florida workers. The American Farm Bureau estimates that United 
States exports for agricultural goods could increase by $1.5 billion 
each year.
  This agreement has generated thoughtful bipartisan support from 
various agricultural, textile, business and political groups. Former 
United States President Carter as well as several key Clinton 
administration officials support DR-CAFTA. I encourage my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this crucial trade agreement that will help 
promote economic growth, political stability and regional security.
