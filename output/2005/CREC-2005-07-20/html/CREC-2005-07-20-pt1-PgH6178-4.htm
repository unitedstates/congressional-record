             31ST ANNIVERSARY OF TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. MALONEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 31st 
anniversary of the 1974 illegal Turkish invasion of Cyprus.
  I have commemorated this day each year since I became a Member of 
Congress. PSEKA, the International Coordinating Committee, Justice for 
Cyrus, the Cyprus Federation of America, the World Council of Hellenes 
Abroad, the Federation of Hellenic Societies are all located in the 
14th Congressional District of New York, which I am fortunate to 
represent.
  These organizations believe that peace will come to Cyprus, and they 
have been strong advocates against the division of Cyprus and the human 
rights violations perpetrated by the Turkish army in Cyprus. While we 
must remember this black anniversary, we also need to look to the 
future. Cyprus' accession to the European Union was an historic 
achievement. As an EU member, Cyprus represents European values and 
policies, and at the same time is working toward even stronger 
transatlantic ties with the United States.
  This was a long time in coming, and I believe that Cyprus has much to 
contribute to the EU. Although all of us,

including the Greek Cypriots and Turkey Cypriots, want to see the 
division of Cyprus end before its entrance into the EU, the Annan plan 
for a Cyprus settlement was justly voted down by the Greek Cypriots by 
an overwhelming 76 percent.
  My colleague, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), 
outlined the many reasons why this vote took place.

  But we have also heard that many of the residents are working to 
resolve these disputes and that there is growing strength for a unified 
Cyprus. A unified Cyprus would promote stability both politically and 
economically to the entire Mediterranean region. The people of Cyprus 
deserve a unified and democratic country, and I remain hopeful that a 
peaceful settlement will be found so that the division of Cyprus will 
come to an end. Some of us are calling for a special envoy to Cyprus to 
work towards achieving that end.
  However, there have been recent developments that concern me, and I 
know that they may concern many of my colleagues. Earlier this month, 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) and I sent a letter, along 
with 30 other Members of this body, to Secretary of State Rice asking 
for clarification about U.S. policy toward Cyprus. Specifically, we are 
seeking answers about the policy of the United States regarding travel 
directly into the northern occupied parts of Cyprus by U.S. citizens.
  While we have not yet heard from the Secretary, I remain hopeful that 
our relations with Cyprus will remain steadfast and that we will 
continue to adhere to international treaties and U.N. Security Council 
resolutions on this issue.
  I also want to mention the ongoing issue in Cyprus over property in 
the northern part of the island. Since Turkey invaded Cyprus, American 
citizens have been denied access to their property even though they 
hold titles to that property. I urge my colleagues to support 
legislation offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), 
H.R. 857, the American-Owned Property in Occupied Cyprus Claims Act, 
which would enable U.S. citizens who own property in the Turkish-
occupied territory of the Republic of Cyprus to seek financial remedies 
with either the current inhabitants of their land or the Turkish 
Government.
  Additionally, I have introduced a resolution, H.R. 322, which 
expresses the sense of the House of Representatives in support of the 
European Court of Human Rights for its decision in the Loizidou v. 
Turkey and the Xenides-Arestis v. Turkey cases and for admitting 
similar cases before the court.
  The European Court of Human Rights in 1996 ruled that Turkey must pay 
Titina Loizidou for denying her access to her property in the occupied 
part of Cyprus. Earlier this year the European Court of Human Rights 
decided that a similar case brought by Xenides-Arestis against Turkey 
was admissible and that Turkey continues to be responsible for what 
happens in the occupied areas of Cyprus since Turkey exercises 
effective and overall control through the presence of over 30,000 
troops in northern Cyprus.
  While I hope that Turkey respects the decisions made by the European 
Court of Human Rights, I believe that denying property owners access to 
their land in northern Cyprus is wrong and that steps should be taken 
immediately to address this issue. Thirty-one years is too long to have 
a divided country. It is too long to be kept from one's home. It is too 
long to be separated from one's family. We have seen many tremendous 
changes around the world. It is time for Cyprus to live in peace and 
security with full enjoyment of their human rights.
  In recognition of the spirit of the people of Cyprus, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in commemorating the 31st anniversary of the 
invasion of Cyprus. Long live freedom. Long live Cyprus. Long live 
Greece. And long live the United States and the friendship between our 
countries.
