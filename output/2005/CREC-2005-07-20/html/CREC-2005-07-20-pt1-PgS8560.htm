          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. DeWine):
  S. 1429. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to assist 
homeless students in obtaining postsecondary education, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
  Ms. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I join Senator DeWine to introduce a 
bill that would make the dream of a college diploma more accessible to 
homeless youth and kids in foster care.
  We all know the obstacles students' in America need to overcome in 
order to succeed in post-secondary education. Couple these traditional 
obstacles with extreme poverty, residential instability, insufficient 
documentation and lack of awareness of supportive educational programs 
and it is no wonder homeless children and children in foster care are 
only half as likely to go on to college as their peers.
  Youth in foster care are less likely to be enrolled in college 
preparatory classes and are more than twice as likely as non-foster 
care youth to drop out of high school altogether. Because The Higher 
Education Act supports several programs that motivate and support 
disadvantaged students to help increase their postsecondary educational 
attainment, it already has many of the tools necessary to intervene in 
these student lives. My bill would help programs, such as TRIO and GEAR 
UP, target their resources to better serve homeless and foster care 
populations. Early intervention is key in retaining these students and 
preparing them for post-secondary education.
  More than 70 percent of teens in foster care desire to go to college, 
only 27 percent of those who graduate from high school realize that 
dream. Although children and youth who experience the instability of 
homelessness or foster care represent the full range of academic 
talents and abilities, their situations create serious barriers to 
school enrollment, attendance, and success.
  Homeless and foster care youth do not have the traditional family 
network to encourage or assist them in planning for a college 
education. These youth need help to select a college, apply for 
admission and obtaining financial aid. In addition, their student aid 
must be used for so much more than just tuition and books. They face 
the daunting challenges of housing, transportation and other basic 
needs. By assisting these youth to become independent students we will 
increase their access to student aid for financial aid purposes; 
improve their changes for a smooth transition into, and completion of, 
higher learning.
  Our nation's economic well-being depends on our ability to provide 
greater access to higher education for students, regardless of their 
family background. By passing this bill we guarantee more students than 
ever will be given the tools they need to attend college and succeed. 
Through college we provide these vulnerable students with the best hope 
for escaping the cycle of poverty and homelessness.
  I look forward to working with HELP Committee Chairman Enzi to 
incorporate these provisions into the Higher Education Act 
reauthorization bill. And again, I thank Senator DeWine for his 
commitment to these often overlooked children.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1429

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Access to 
     Education for Students Who Are Homeless or in Foster Care 
     Act''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) According to a study of foster care children in the 
     State of Washington, a child who enters foster care is likely 
     to have poorer academic outcomes than a child not in foster 
     care, even after controlling for a variety of factors such as 
     poverty.
       (2) Youth in foster care--
       (A) are less likely to be enrolled in college preparatory 
     classes than non-foster care youth; and
       (B) are more than twice as likely as non-foster care youth 
     (37 percent as compared to 16 percent) to have dropped out of 
     secondary school.
       (3) 50 percent of foster youth in the United States 
     graduate from secondary school, compared with 85 percent of 
     youth overall.
       (4) 70 percent of teens in foster care desire to go to 
     college.
       (5) A report from Casey Family Programs indicated that, 
     nationwide, less than 27 percent of foster youth who 
     graduated from secondary school went on to college, as 
     compared to 52 percent of the general population. Moreover, 
     the college dropout rate among foster youth is far higher 
     than the rate among other students.
       (6) A May 2002 report issued by the University of 
     California at Berkeley found that, of more than 3,200 foster 
     care youth who attended a community college from 1992 through 
     2000--
       (A) 39 percent earned between 1 and 17 credits;
       (B) 40 percent of the foster care youth earned no credits; 
     and
       (C) many of the foster care youth did not attempt to take 
     classes for credit, but rather were enrolled in remedial or 
     other non-credit classes.
       (7) Unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness often 
     have left home for their own survival.

[[Page S8561]]

       (8) Although children and youth who experience homelessness 
     represent the full range of academic talents and abilities, 
     homelessness creates serious barriers to school enrollment, 
     attendance, and success.
       (9) The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 
     11301 et seq.) requires State educational agencies and local 
     educational agencies to ensure that homeless children and 
     youth receive a free and appropriate public education, but 
     these provisions do not reach beyond secondary education.
       (10) The barriers created by homelessness to kindergarten 
     through grade 12 education (extreme poverty, residential 
     instability, lack of documentation, and lack of awareness of 
     programs and resources) often are also barriers to 
     postsecondary education.
       (11) Higher education offers students experiencing 
     homelessness the best hope for escaping poverty and 
     homelessness as adults.

     SEC. 307. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this 
     title $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and such sums as may 
     be necessary for each of the 5 succeeding fiscal years.
  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join Senator Murray in introducing 
the ``Improving Access to Education for Students Who Are Homeless or in 
Foster Care Act.'' I thank Senator Murray for her deep commitment to 
the education of children who are homeless or in foster care. I have 
worked with her on provisions to promote their access to and completion 
of education in both the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(IDEA) reauthorization and the Head Start Act reauthorization and am 
pleased to have worked with her again on this bill.
  In the United States, on any given day, more than half a million 
children are in foster care--20,000 of whom are in the State of Ohio, 
alone. In 2003, also know that more than 900,000 children were found to 
be victims of child abuse or neglect. More than half of the children in 
foster care experience developmental delays. Children in foster care 
have three to seven times more chronic medical conditions, birth 
defects, emotional disorders, and academic failures than children of 
similar socioeconomic backgrounds who do not enter foster care.
  We also know that homeless children face great barriers to higher 
education. Often, these students have run away from an abusive home, or 
have been lost to the system. These students also may be living on the 
street with a parent--too often with a parent suffering from an 
addiction to alcohol or drugs. These children will move from school to 
school and shelter to shelter, piecing together their education as they 
can. This is not good enough. Although we have tried to reach out to 
these students through the McKinney Vento Homelessness Assistance Act, 
we need to do more. These children deserve a better chance at an 
education.
  Education offers foster care and homeless children their best hope 
for escaping the poverty and instability they experience. This bill 
includes additional outreach to these hard to reach populations through 
current Federal education programs, such as TRIO and GEAR UP. It also 
would expand and clarify the definition of ``Independent Student'' in 
order to accommodate the special circumstances of foster care and 
homeless children and would allow student financial aid administrators 
additional flexibility to help this cohort of students attain access to 
higher education. This bill would create a $20 million demonstration 
grant program targeting foster and homeless children to help decrease 
the barriers to higher education by involving stakeholders and their 
communities in the outreach process.
  I look forward to working with HELP Committee Chairman Enzi to 
incorporate these provisions into the Higher Education Act 
reauthorization bill. I appreciate his willingness to incorporate 
provisions related to homeless and foster children in the Head Start 
Act reauthorization bill, as well. He is equally concerned with the 
welfare of these children. And again, I thank Senator Murray for her 
commitment to these children. We cannot afford to overlook their needs.

  S. 1436. A bill to award grants to eligible entities to enable the 
entities to reduce the rate of underage alcohol use and binge drinking 
among students at institutions of higher education; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I join several of my colleagues today to 
introduce a series of bills related to the reauthorization of the 
Higher Education Act (HEA). These bills emphasize a number of issues 
that are vital to higher education, including teacher quality, 
recruitment, and retention; loan forgiveness for social workers, family 
lawyers, and early childhood teachers; and the reduction of drug use 
and underage drinking at our colleges and universities.
  The quality of a student's education is the direct result of the 
quality of that student's teachers. If we don't have well trained 
teachers, then future generations of our children will not be well 
educated. That is why I am introducing a bill ``Ready to Educate All 
Children Act'' that would provide $200 million in grants to our schools 
of education to partner with high-need local schools to ensure that our 
teachers are receiving the best, most extensive training available 
before they enter the classroom.
  Studies find that a majority of graduates of schools of education 
believe that the traditional teacher preparation program left them ill 
prepared for the challenges and rigors of the classroom. Part of the 
responsibility for this lies in the hands of our schools of education. 
However, Congress also has a responsibility to give our schools of 
education the tools they need to make necessary improvements. This new 
bill would create a competitive grant program for schools of education, 
which partner with low-income schools to create clinical programs to 
train teachers. Additionally, it would require schools of education to 
make internal changes by working with other departments at the 
university to ensure that teachers are receiving the highest quality 
education in core academic subjects. Finally, it would require the 
college or university to demonstrate a commitment to improving their 
schools of education by providing matching funds.
  Another bill I am introducing today, is the ``Collaborative 
Agreements to Recruit Educators Act,'' which also would encourage 
improvement in the education of our Nation's low-income students. 
Children raised in poverty have a much more difficult time in finishing 
high school and going on to college. While about seventy percent of 
children in America will graduate from high school, that rate drops to 
fifty percent for low-income students. We know that every day, about 
3,000 children drop out of school. Our Nation's inner city schools have 
some of the lowest rates of graduation. I strongly believe that 
education is one of the most important ways to break the cycle of 
poverty. To break that cycle, we must keep our children in school, help 
them graduate from high school, and increase their access to higher 
education.
  My bill would provide grants for collaborative agreements to between 
local education agencies in low-income communities and to colleges of 
education. These partnerships would work to provide services, such as 
mentoring, tutoring, and scholarships through the college of education 
to the students at the partnering school in order to 1. encourage those 
students to graduate from high school, 2. let them know of 
opportunities within higher education, and (3) encourage them to become 
teachers, which are so badly needed.
  Another complex issue affecting the teaching force is the high 
percentage of disillusioned beginning teachers who leave the field. 
This bill would help combat this issue, as well. Schools of education 
receiving these grants would be responsible for following their 
graduates and continuing to provide assistance after they enter the 
classroom. The more we invest in the education of teachers--especially 
once they have entered the profession--the more likely they will remain 
in the classroom.
  To further help teacher quality and retention, I am introducing a 
bill ``The Master Teacher Scholarship Act''--to establish a Master's in 
Education Scholarship Program. The lack of promotions and salary 
increases are some of the most pervasive reasons for the 
disillusionment of teachers. This disillusionment is becoming a crisis 
as half of teachers leave the profession altogether within their first 
five years of teaching. To both improve the quality of teachers and 
increase their retention, this bill would provide $30 million in grants 
to schools of education to administer scholarships to eligible 
teachers. In return for the scholarships, teachers would agree to teach 
for another five years and mentor a novice teacher for two years.
  Today, along with Senator Dodd, I am introducing the ``Paul Wellstone 
Early Educator Loan Forgiveness Act.'' Our dear friend and colleague, 
Senator Wellstone, and I had been working on this legislation together 
before his tragic death. I know he cared deeply about this issue and 
about making sure that all children receive a quality education. He was 
passionate about that. Though our bill was originally called the 
``Early Care and Education Loan Forgiveness Act,'' we have renamed our 
bill in Paul's memory.
  Our bill would expand the loan forgiveness program so that it 
benefits not just childcare workers, but also early childhood 
educators. This loan forgiveness program would serve as an incentive to 
keep those educators in the field for longer periods of time. Research 
shows that children who attend quality early childcare programs when 
they were three or four years old scored better on math, language arts, 
and social skills in early elementary school than children who attended 
poor quality childcare programs. In short, children in early learning 
programs with high quality teachers--teachers with a Bachelor's degree 
or an Associate's degree or higher--do substantially better.
  When we examine the number and recent growth of pre-primary education 
programs, it becomes difficult to differentiate between early education 
and childcare settings because they are so often intertwined--
especially considering that about 12 million children younger than age 
five spend part of their time with a care provider other than a parent 
and that demand for quality childcare and education is growing as more 
mothers enter the workforce.
  Because this bill targets loan forgiveness to those educators working 
in low-income schools or childcare settings, we can make significant 
strides toward providing high quality education for all of our young 
children, regardless of socioeconomic status. The bill would serve a 
twofold function. First, it would reward professionals for their 
training. Second, it would encourage professionals to remain in the 
profession over longer periods of time, since more time in the 
profession leads to higher percentages of loans forgiveness. The bill 
would result in more educated individuals with more teaching experience 
and lower turnover rates, each of which enhance student performance.
  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to help ensure 
that truly

[[Page S8564]]

no children--especially our youngest children--are left behind.
  I also am working on two bills with my friend and colleague from West 
Virginia, Senator Rockefeller. These bills would provide loan 
forgiveness to students who dedicate their careers to working in the 
realm of child welfare, including social workers, who work for child 
protective services, and family law experts.

  Currently, there aren't enough social workers to fill available jobs 
in the area of child welfare. Furthermore, the number of social work 
job openings is expected to increase faster than the average for all 
occupations through 2010. The need for highly qualified social workers 
in the child protective services is reaching crisis level.
  We also need more qualified individuals focusing on family law. The 
wonderful thing about family law is its focus on rehabilitation--that 
is the rehabilitation of families by helping them through life's 
transitions, whether it is a family going through a divorce, a family 
dealing with their troubled teenager in the juvenile system, or a child 
getting adopted and becoming a member of a new family.
  Across the United States, family, juvenile, and domestic relations 
courts are experiencing a shortage of qualified attorneys. As many of 
my colleagues and I know, law school is an expensive investment. In the 
last 20 years, tuition has increased more than 200 percent. Currently, 
the average rate of law school debt is about $80,000 per graduate. To 
be sure, few law school graduates can afford to work in the public 
sector because debts prevent even the most dedicated public service 
lawyer from being able to take these low-paying jobs. This results in a 
shortage of family lawyers.
  The shortage of family law attorneys also disproportionately impacts 
juveniles. The lack of available representation causes children to 
spend more time in foster care because cases are adjourned or postponed 
when they simply cannot find an attorney to represent their rights or 
those of the parent or guardian. Furthermore, the number of children 
involved in the court system is sharply increasing. We need to ensure 
that the interests of these children are taken care of by making 
certain they have an advocate--someone working solely on their behalf. 
By offering loan forgiveness to those willing to pursue careers in the 
child welfare field, we can increase the number of highly qualified and 
dedicated individuals who work in the realm of child welfare and family 
law.
  Finally, I am introducing a bill today that would help address an 
epidemic--the epidemic of underage drinking on college and university 
campuses across the United States. This bill would provide grants to 
states to establish statewide partnerships among colleges and 
universities and the surrounding communities to work together to reduce 
underage and binge drinking and illicit drug use by students.
  Many States, including my home State of Ohio, have coalitions that 
deal specifically with the culture of alcohol and drug abuse on 
America's college campuses. They work with the surrounding communities, 
including local residents; bar, restaurant, and shop owners; and law 
enforcement officials toward a goal of changing the pervasive culture 
of drug and alcohol abuse. They provide alternative alcohol-free 
events, as well as support groups for those who choose not to drink. 
They also educate students about the dangers of alcohol and drug use.
  Furthermore, the coalitions recognize that while it is important to 
promote an alcohol aware and drug-free campus community, if the 
community surrounding the campus does not promote these initiatives, 
there will be no long-term solutions. Therefore, these coalitions also 
have worked to establish regulations both on and off campus, which will 
help our Nation's youth to stay healthy, alive, and get the most out of 
their time at college. Some of these regulations include the 
registration of kegs. This provides accountability for both the store 
and the student. This is just an example of one step that colleges, 
local communities, and organizations can take.
  To help start the expansion of these coalitions, this bill would 
provide $5 million in grants. This is an important demonstration 
project that would help lead to positive effects for our young people. 
It is up to us to change the culture, which has been perpetuated by 
years of complacency and a dismissal tone of ``that's just the way it 
is in college.'' We must protect the health and education of our young 
people by changing this culture of abuse--and that is exactly what this 
bill would help do.
  I thank all of my colleagues who have worked with me on these bills. 
I look forward to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and 
working with Chairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy to incorporate 
these important measures.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):
  S. 1439. A bill to provide for Indian trust asset management reform 
and resolution of historical accounting claims, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Indian Affairs.
  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the, Indian 
Trust Reform Act of 2005.
  The following is an overview of the bill, title by title, which is 
followed by a discussion of the reasons for the measure.


Title I: Resolution of historical accounting claims in Cobell v. Norton

  Title I of the bill would provide for a lump sum settlement of the 
claims for an historical accounting that have been asserted in the case 
of Cobell v. Norton. The section would establish a Settlement Fund 
which would be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury and a 
Special Master. The total amount of the fund is left blank in this 
introduced version of the bill. The Committee on Indian Affairs will 
hold a hearing on this soon and have further discussions with the 
parties, hopefully to reach a consensus number for the settlement. The 
settlement fund would be distributed to individual Indians using two 
formulas: part of the fund would be distributed among all claimants 
equally, and part would be distributed under a formula that allocates 
funds in accordance with a through-put analysis--account holders with 
high volume accounts would receive more than those with low volume 
accounts. A portion of the fund would be held in reserve for payment of 
attorneys fees at an hourly rate, for administration of the fund and 
for claimants who successfully challenge their distribution in court. 
If any of the reserved funds remain unused, they are to be distributed 
to the claimants under the formula.


    Title II: Indian Trust Asset Management Policy Review Commission

  Title II of the bill establishes and sets forth the duties, 
responsibilities, and authority of a 12-member Indian Trust Asset 
Management Review Commission. The Commission would have two principal 
areas of responsibility: 1. Reviewing all current trust resource 
management laws, (including regulations), and the Secretary of 
Interior's trust resource management practices, and 2. Following that 
review, preparing a report to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, 
the House Committee on Resources and the Secretary of Interior 
containing the Commission's recommendations for improving the 
management of those assets.


   Title III: Indian Trust Resource Management Demonstration Project

  Title III of the bill establishes an eight-year Indian Trust Resource 
Management Demonstration Project. The demonstration project would 
initially be open to all Indian tribes participating in section 131 of 
the Fiscal Year 2005 Interior Appropriations Act and an additional 30 
Indian tribes that submit applications to the Secretary. Participating 
tribes would negotiate a ``trust resource management plan'' with the 
Secretary, which would remain in effect for the full duration of the 
demonstration project but would be subject to modification or 
termination annually. A participating tribe would be allowed to 
negotiate with the Department of Interior as to how the trust asset 
management budget for the reservation would be prioritized. Self-
governance tribes participating in the demonstration project would also 
be permitted to develop their own ``customized'' trust asset management 
systems and practices. Trust assets subject to the plan would have to 
be managed in accordance with 1. The Federal trust responsibility and 
2. Certain basic standards set forth in the section. The trust asset 
management plan itself would not create, diminish or increase

[[Page S8565]]

the liability of either the United States or the Indian tribe. The 
Indian tribe would have the right to terminate the plan by giving the 
Secretary notice, but termination would not be effective until the 
beginning of the next fiscal year.


    Title IV: Fractional Interest Purchase and Consolidation Program

  Title IV of the bill would be an amendment to Section 213 of the 
Indian Land Consolidation Act (25 USC 2212). As currently written, 
Section 213 of ILCA authorizes the Secretary to purchase fractional 
interests in land in accordance with certain requirements. One problem 
with this program is that the fractional interests are so small that an 
offer of fair market value is such a small amount of money that there 
is little incentive to sell. Accordingly, the amendment would be a new 
subsection to ILCA Section 213 that would authorize the Secretary to 
offer more than fair market value for fractional interests in tracts of 
land that have 20 or more trust or restricted fractional interests--the 
offer would be fair market value PLUS an additional amount of at least 
$100 but not more than $350.
  Also, this title would add another new subsection to ILCA section 213 
that would authorize the Secretary to offer, along with an offer to 
purchase any interest or interests under section 213, an additional 
amount of money to settle any and all mismanagement claims against the 
United States that the interest owner may have in connection with the 
tract of land of which the fractional interest is a part. The interest 
owner would have the option of selling his or her interest to the 
Secretary with or without a settlement of mismanagement claims, i.e., 
the settlement of mismanagement claims could not be made a mandatory 
condition of the sale of the interest.
  Also included as part of this title is a provision dealing with 
tracts of extremely fractionated land--specifically, tracts of land 
that consist of 200 or more fractional trust interests. If the 
Secretary determines that a tract is owned by 200 or more individuals, 
she is authorized to make the offer (not less than four times fair 
market value) via certified mail to each and every trust interest owner 
in the tract. The offer would include a notice that says they have 90 
days to reject the offer or it will be deemed to have been accepted. It 
would include a pre-addressed (back to the Secretary) postage-paid 
``notice of rejection'' form that the offeree may use to reject the 
offer. If they fail to mail the form back in time, they will be given 
another notice stating that they may withdraw the offer by mailing a 
postage pre-paid ``notice of withdrawal'' form back to the Secretary 
within 30 days. If They fail to do that in time, the offer is deemed to 
be accepted.


 Title V: Restructuring the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Office of the 
                            Special Trustee

  This title of the bill would reorganize the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
and Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians under a new 
office within the Department of Interior, an Under Secretary for Indian 
Affairs. The title provides that the Under Secretary has 
responsibility for the administration of all Indian trust and non-trust 
matters, including, after a transition period ending on December 31, 
2008, matters currently within the scope of authority of the Special 
Trustee for American Indians under the American Indian Trust Fund 
Management Reform Act of 1994 (25 USC 4041 et seq.). The Under 
Secretary would oversee a new Office of Trust Reform Implementation and 
Oversight, but the Special Trustee would continue performing his duties 
under the 1994 Act until December 31, 2008, at which time the OST would 
be abolished.


    Title VI: Annual Audit of Indian Trust Funds by the Government 
                         Accountability Office

  Title VI of the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to 
contract for an annual audit of all funds held in trust by the United 
States for the benefit of an Indian Tribe or an individual Indian. The 
audit would be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
principles and the Single Audit Act. Copies of each audit report must 
be submitted to the Secretary of Interior, the Senate Committee on 
Indian Affairs, and the House Committee on Resources.
  Reasons for the bill: the performance of the United States over the 
past 125 years in its capacity as trustee and manager of Indian trust 
and restricted lands is not something to be proud of. The policy of 
allotting Indian tribal lands, which was made the general Federal 
Indian policy in the 1880s, was one of several federal ``experiments'' 
in Indian matters that have had regrettable results both for Native 
Americans and for the Government. This policy of the 19th Century has 
come back to haunt us now in the form of fractionated ownership of 
allotted lands--where some parcels of land are owned by hundreds and in 
some cases over a thousand different Indian owners. This fractionation 
of ownership has led to a proliferation of individual Indian money 
accounts ``IIM accounts,'' now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, 
all of which the Federal Government has a trust obligation to track and 
manage.
  The staggering number of IIM accounts--along with decades of 
mismanagement on the part of Government officials--contributed to the 
conditions that led to the filing of the Federal class action here in 
the District of Columbia known as Cobell v. Norton. A lot has happened 
in that litigation since it was filed 9 years ago, much of it reported 
in newspapers across the country, but I think it is fair to say that 
one thing the case has shown is that the United States has not lived up 
to its duty as a fiduciary to the thousands of Indian beneficiaries of 
IIM accounts.
  The principal objectives of the Cobell case are to obtain a complete 
historical accounting of IIM accounts and to reform the trust itself. 
The Government has been ordered to perform a complete, detailed 
accounting of transactions relating to IIM accounts and to submit and 
implement a plan to reform the trust. In hearings before the Committee 
on Indian Affairs, officials from the Department of Interior have 
stated that the cost of doing the accounting may run in to multiple 
billions of dollars, and representatives of the plaintiffs in the case 
as well as the GAO, have stated that much of this accounting cannot be 
done due to missing or destroyed records, information, or data relating 
to the IIM accounts.
  The bill I introduce today would provide a resolution of the class 
action relating to an historical accounting and would also bring a 
number of important changes to the Indian trust asset management 
system. In lieu of an accounting, the bill would create a settlement 
fund and direct the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a formula for 
distributing the fund to the beneficial owners of IIM accounts in full 
settlement for losses, errors, and unpaid interest in their IIM 
accounts. Several other aspects of the bill are included for the 
purpose of reforming the Indian trust management system. For example, 
the bill would create a special commission charged with the 
responsibility of examining current Indian trust management laws, 
regulations and practices and reporting back to the authorizing 
committees of jurisdiction in the Senate and House with recommended 
revisions of these laws, regulations and practices. It would also 
restructure the Bureau of Indian Affairs under an Under Secretary For 
Indian Affairs, phasing out the Office of the Special Trustee whose 
responsibilities would be transferred to the Under Secretary after 
December 31, 2008.
  I would like to thank the National Congress of American Indians, the 
Inter-Tribal Monitoring Association, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest 
Indians, representatives of the plaintiffs as well as many other 
stakeholders for their considerable and helpful input in developing 
this legislation. The bill does not include everything that they 
requested, and they may have issues with certain aspects of the bill as 
it is now written. That said, the bill is offered as a starting point 
for discussion. I do not think that there is any provision in the bill 
that is immutable, closed to debate or negotiation. Hopefully the 
stakeholders will remain engaged and continue to provide me with 
information and suggestions to make it a better bill, a bill that 
brings substantial improvements to the administration and management of 
Indian trust assets.

       Congress finds that--
       (1) Congress has appropriated tens of millions of dollars 
     for purposes of providing an historical accounting of funds 
     held in Individual Indian Money accounts;
       (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the efforts of 
     the Federal Government in conducting historical accounting 
     activities have provided information regarding the 
     feasibility and cost of providing a complete historical 
     accounting of IIM account funds;
       (3) in the case of many IIM accounts, a complete historical 
     accounting--
       (A) may be impossible because necessary records and 
     accounting data are missing or destroyed;
       (B) may take several years to perform even if necessary 
     records are available;
       (C) may cost the United States hundreds of millions and 
     possibly several billion dollars; and
       (D) may be impossible to complete before the deaths of many 
     elderly IIM account beneficiaries;
       (4) without a complete historical accounting, it may be 
     difficult or impossible to ascertain the extent of losses in 
     an IIM account as a result of accounting errors or 
     mismanagement of funds, or the correct amount of interest 
     accrued or owned on the IIM account;
       (5) the total cost to the United States of providing a 
     complete historical accounting of an IIM account may exceed--
       (A) the current balance of the IIM account;
       (B) the total sums of money that have passed through the 
     IIM account; and
       (C) the enforceable liability of the United States for 
     losses from, and interest in, the IIM account;
       (6)(A) the delays in obtaining an accounting and in 
     pursuing accounting claims in the case styled Cobell v. 
     Norton, Civil Action No. 96-1285 (RCL) in the United States 
     District Court for the District of Columbia, have created a 
     great hardship on IIM account beneficiaries; and
       (B) many beneficiaries and their representatives have 
     indicated that they would rather receive monetary 
     compensation than experience the continued frustration and 
     delay associated with an accounting of transactions and funds 
     in their IIM accounts;
       (7) it is appropriate for Congress, taking into 
     consideration the findings under paragraphs (1) through (6), 
     to provide benefits that are reasonably calculated to be fair 
     and appropriate in lieu of performing an accounting of an IIM 
     account, or assuming liability for errors in such an 
     accounting, mismanagement of IIM account funds (including 
     undetermined amounts of interest in IIM accounts, losses in 
     which may never be discovered or quantified if a complete 
     historical accounting cannot be performed), or breach of 
     fiduciary duties with respect to the administration of IIM 
     accounts, in order to transmute claims by the beneficiaries 
     of IIM accounts for undetermined or unquantified accounting 
     losses and interest to a fixed amount to be distributed to 
     the beneficiaries of IIM accounts;
       (8) in determining the amount of the payments to be 
     distributed as described in paragraph (7), Congress should 
     take into consideration, in addition to the factors described 
     in paragraphs (1) through (6)--
       (A) the risks and costs to IIM account beneficiaries, as 
     well as any delay, associated with the litigation of claims 
     that will be resolved by this title; and
       (B) the benefits to IIM account beneficiaries available 
     under this title;
       (9) the situation of the Osage Nation is unique because, 
     among other things, income from the mineral estate of the 
     Osage Nation is distributed to individuals through headright 
     interests that belong not only to members of the Osage 
     Nation, but also to members of other Indian tribes, and to 
     non-Indians; and
       (10) due to the unique situation of the Osage Nation, the 
     Osage Nation, on its own behalf, has filed various actions in 
     Federal district court and the United States Court of Federal 
     Claims seeking accountings, money damages, and other legal 
     and equitable relief

     SEC. 602. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are 
     necessary to carry out this title.
  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator McCain in 
introducing this historic legislation. This bill is a necessary 
starting point to begin resolution of the longstanding claims in the 
Cobell v. Norton litigation, which involves the Federal Government's 
mismanagement of hundreds of thousands of individual Indian money 
accounts. The bill was drafted in a bipartisan manner and attempts to 
address the principles recently developed and set forth by Indian 
Country.
  I want to thank the National Congress of American Indians and the 
InterTribal Monitoring Association for leading the consultative process 
utilized in developing these principles. Those principles helped guide 
the drafting of this bill. The current language of the bill, however, 
is not perfect. Rather, it is intended to be a starting point for 
substantive and productive dialogue between the parties. Recently, the 
parties engaged in a 9-month mediation process that failed to result in 
any type of potential resolution. This litigation is nearly a decade 
old and has no end in sight. It is my hope that this bill will assist 
the parties in reaching some type of resolution of this litigation.
  The individual Indian trust account system was not a voluntary system 
elected by the individual Indians, but rather one imposed upon them by 
the federal government more than one hundred years ago. The Federal 
Government serves as trustee of these accounts and the individual 
Indians are beneficiaries. Unfortunately, the Cobell litigation has 
brought to light a very disturbing problem: the Federal Government, as 
trustee, may not be able to provide an accurate and proper historical 
accounting of these accounts. Moreover, the Federal Government may not 
know the proper balances of these accounts nor have sufficient 
documentation to determine the value of these accounts. Further, 
government officials have stated that a full transaction-by-transaction 
accounting, presuming one can be performed, would cost more than $10 
billion. This cost would not include any monies determined to be 
unaccounted for or the interest on those monies.
  The claims in the Cobell litigation on examples of broken promises 
and trust responsibilities to the Native Americans of this country, but 
it is my hope and desire that this bill will help us keep those 
promises, fulfill our responsibilities to Native Americans, and restore 
trust and faith in our government. If Congress continues to allow the 
Cobell litigation to proceed, the individual beneficiaries of these 
accounts will not be alive to reap the benefits these accounts and the 
trust resource management system were intended to bestow.
  It is an honor to serve as Vice Chairman of the Committee on Indian 
Affairs alongside chairman McCain. We have publicly pledged that we 
will make our best effort to resolve this long overdue injustice to the 
first Americans. The introduction of this bill is the first step toward 
that goal.
