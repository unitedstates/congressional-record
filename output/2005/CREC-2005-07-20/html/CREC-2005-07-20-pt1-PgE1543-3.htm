THE 31ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ILLEGAL TURKISH INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF 
                                 CYPRUS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. STEVEN R. ROTHMAN

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. ROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and bring 
attention to the illegal Turkish invasion and occupation of Cyprus. It 
was 31 years ago today that Turkey invaded Cyprus. During the invasion 
they expelled 200,000 Greek-Cypriots from their homes and 
neighborhoods, making them refugees overnight. Turkish troops killed 
5,000 Greek-Cypriots, of which 1,500 are still missing. There have been 
30,000 Turkish troops occupying the island nation of Cyprus ever since.
  It is the proper role of the Members of the United States Congress to 
not only condemn the brutal Turkish invasion of 1974, but also to urge 
the next step in addressing the issues of the past. We must promote a 
plan for reunification that addresses the serious concerns of all 
Cypriots. We must encourage Turkish-Cypriot leaders and their Greek-
Cypriot counterparts to negotiate in good faith. We must show the world 
that the reunification of Cyprus is a priority for the United States.
  On the 31st anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, we grieve 
for those killed during the invasion, and we lament the lost 
opportunities for reunification over the years. We urge both parties to 
continue to work toward a reunited and peaceful Cyprus.
