                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Albert R. 
Robbins. Known to most of his friends as Al or ``Abbie,'' he has been a 
well respected pillar of the community and a man of many 
accomplishments since his early years.
  Mr. Robbins has been a life long resident of Philadelphia. A product 
of the Abington Public School System, Abbie served our country with 
honor as a member of the US Army's 5th Division in Europe. He resumed 
his education after completing his tour of duty, earning a Bachelor of 
Science Degree from Cheyney State Teachers College in 1959. Sports and 
music have always been an important part of his life. While at Cheyney, 
he sang with the traveling choir for four years and was a member of the 
football team. While beginning his career as an Industrial Arts teacher 
in the Pottstown School District, he enrolled in graduate courses at 
Temple University and Penn State for his Masters degree in education. 
In 1964, during the Civil rights movement, Al broke through color 
barriers by becoming the first African American bus driver hired by 
Eastern Greyhound Lines where he worked part time until 1980.
  Mr. Robbins has been a member of countless public service 
organizations, including the Sanctuary Choir of the St. Paul's Baptist 
Church of Philadelphia, LAAP, ALAA, NEA, PABA, NAACP, Pottstown 
Education Assoc., and the Montgomery County Industrial Arts 
Association. He is also a past commander of V.F.W. Post 3389 and a 
lifetime member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity.
  Mr. Robbins is retiring after 34 years of service in the field of 
Technology and Education with many great accomplishments. In 
recognition of his years of service I ask that you and my other 
distinguished colleagues rise to congratulate him on his retirement.
