  Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, God's whisper to come on home to Brenda 
[Brenda Pillors], our sister in service and life, on the frontlines in 
the battles and opportunities to improve life and health for all, came 
on June 12, 2005.
  It is with honor that I present this special tribute in memory of our 
outstanding colleague and dear friend, Brenda Pillors, Chief of Staff 
to Congressman Ed Towns. Today, July 20th marks what would have been a 
celebration of Brenda's earthly birthday. Colleagues, family and 
friends know personally that Brenda did so very, very much to improve 
the lives and the quality thereof for people everywhere and across all 
walks of life.
  Brenda's impact on health legislation, policy and all other aspects 
thereof remains from that on minority health and health disparities, to 
health professions, to children's and women's health; from Medicare and 
Medicaid, to healthcare reform, to health commissions and agency 
advisory councils, to the National Health Service Corps; from NIH, to 
FDA, to SAMHSA, to CDC, to HRSA, to AHRQ, to OMH, to OCR, to IOM; for 
HIV/AIDS, to diabetes, to obesity, to sickle cell disease, to cancer, 
to heart disease; from clinical trials, to life trials; from 
bioengineering, to health technology, to alternative medicine; from 
behavioral health, to workforce diversity, to affirmative action.
  Brenda Pillors was always there--from pharmacology, to immunology, to 
vaccines; from hospitals, to community health centers, to men's health; 
from environmental health, to health justice, to nutrition, to birth 
defects; from the uninsured and underinsured, to urban and rural 
health; from infant mortality, to head start, to mental health; from 
nurses, to doctors, to specialists, to community health workers, to 
researchers; to private and public sector officials; from you to me. 
Her impact goes on and on--you know Brenda's tremendous heart, impact 
and reach.
  We will always remember you Brenda--your dedication, your commitment, 
your leadership, your expertise and your understanding, and indeed your 
smile, your laughter and your voice. Brenda Pillors--truly a leader in 
public service and servant in God's army of service and love.
  My ``Sister,'' we will miss you always--your legacy of achievements 
is written in the hearts of the lives of those you have helped and 
touched in oh so many, many ways. Your presence and legacy is embedded 
in the walls and along the halls of the U.S. Congress, and is written 
in legislation, Congressional hearing questions and transcripts, 
hearing reports, committee and conference reports, agency reports and 
justifications, and throughout the Congressional Record.
  Brenda was and truly lived the ``purpose driven life.'' Thousands, 
upon thousands, upon thousands, upon thousands of lives have been 
improved and in fact many saved, and futures are much brighter because 
of Brenda's life and works. The majority of the people who have and 
will benefit from her works will never know her. Even the lives of 
generations to come will benefit from her work. We have always been 
proud of Brenda.
  Dear Brenda, we thank you, and we salute you and we honor you--our 
``sister in service striving throughout her life to ensure justice and 
equality for all--Brenda Pillors, PhD.''
  Reflections of our love, appreciation and respect for Brenda Pillors, 
on this day which would have marked her 53rd birthday. From me to you, 
we thank God and your family for sharing you with us, the Nation and 
the world--Fredette (Fredette West).
