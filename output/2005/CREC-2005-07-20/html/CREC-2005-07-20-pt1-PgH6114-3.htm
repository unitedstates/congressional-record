                      PATRIOT ACT REAUTHORIZATION

  (Mr. CARTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER. Mr. Speaker, after 9/11, my fellow lawmakers wanted to 
make sure that the PATRIOT Act would protect Americans without 
trampling the civil rights that we cherish in this Nation. Mr. Speaker, 
today, 4 years later, the verdict is in. The PATRIOT Act works and is 
helping defeat terrorism. Those of us who thought the threat of 
terrorism receded can only look at Great Britain to know that this is 
not the case. Complacency allows waves of terror to come crashing over 
free nations. The attacks on London show that the war on terror is not 
over nor is it confined to a specific location. Securing our homeland 
is only one facet of the war. Spreading democracy in the savage lands 
where terrorism propagates is another.
  The PATRIOT Act gives us enforcement tools that keep America safe. 
The PATRIOT Act has removed major legal barriers that prevented law 
enforcement agencies from coordinating their work. It has also allowed 
law enforcement to use surveillance against terror-related activities 
and allowed the issuance of nationwide search warrants. The PATRIOT Act 
is doing exactly what it is supposed to do. We cannot allow these 
terrorists to gain momentum in this fight.
