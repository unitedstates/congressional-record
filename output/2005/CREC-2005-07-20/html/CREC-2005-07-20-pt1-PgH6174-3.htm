               ENSURE AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS WITH CAFTA

  (Mr. Lewis of Kentucky asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of the 
U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement. This 
agreement will ensure America's competitiveness in Central America and 
throughout the world, benefiting millions of American farmers, 
manufacturers and businesses of all sizes.
  The CAFTA region currently imports $15 billion annually of U.S. 
agriculture and manufactured goods. Combined, DR-CAFTA countries 
represent our thirteenth largest export market. DR-CAFTA will 
significantly increase exports and boost earnings for American farmers 
and manufacturers. Upon enactment, 80 percent of U.S. industrial 
consumer products will immediately become duty-free, leveling the 
playing field for U.S. producers who have long been at a competitive 
disadvantage with other countries with pre-existing trade agreements in 
the region.
  The proposed agreement will also take important new steps to protect 
U.S. firms from unfair trading practices and elevate standards for 
workplace safety and environmental responsibility. DR-CAFTA legislation 
will also take important new steps to protect U.S. firms from unfair 
trading practices and elevate standards for workplace safety and 
environmental responsibility. DR-CAFTA legislation will be a catalyst 
for positive change in Central America, broadly opening new markets, 
supporting stability, and propelling emerging economies forward.
  As history has proven, politically and economically stable neighbor 
nations are vital to our own national security interests.
