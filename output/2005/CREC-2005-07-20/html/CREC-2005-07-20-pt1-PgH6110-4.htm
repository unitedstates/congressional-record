              CELEBRATING THE SUCCESSES OF FREE ENTERPRISE

  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call the body's 
attention to a sheet of paper that the Committee on Ways and Means has 
produced for the membership this morning. It is the top 10 reasons the 
economy is strong.
  The late Alex Haley used to say, find the good and praise it. Mr. 
Speaker, this morning I would like to pause and praise the free 
enterprise system and the wonderful men and women, the small business 
owners who have put their energy into building a strong economy. It is 
their work. They create the jobs, not us. It is government's job to 
create the environment and get out of the way and let free enterprise 
do what it does best.
  The items, the 10 items on this list are so encouraging. 
Unemployment, near historic lows, 5 percent; 4.4 percent average GDP 
growth since June of last year; 3.7 percent growth in manufacturing 
output since June of last year.
  The economy is strong. Free enterprise is doing its job. Mr. Speaker, 
let us celebrate that success.
