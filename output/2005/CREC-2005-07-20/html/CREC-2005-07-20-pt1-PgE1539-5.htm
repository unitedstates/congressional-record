     TRIBUTE TO SUBHASHREE MADHAVAN AND THE REMBRANDT PROJECT TEAM

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend one of my 
constituents, Subhashree Madhavan, and her Rembrandt Project Team at 
the National Institutes of Health. Ms. Madhavan and her colleagues were 
recently named among thirty finalists for the 2005 Service to America 
medals awarded by the Partnership for Public Service.

[[Page E1540]]

  The Service to America award program recognizes career Federal 
employees for their significant contributions to the Nation. Recipients 
of the ``Sammies'' are among the best and brightest of our public 
servants. While we seldom give public recognition to their efforts, 
they devote their lives and careers to the cause of our national 
welfare. They are models to the rest of the Federal workforce and 
inspirations to us all.
  Since joining the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics 
at NIH, Ms. Madhavan has overseen the development of the Rembrandt 
Project. Rembrandt (REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa) is a 
database that brings together data from an NCI clinical study with a 
vast store of existing data on brain tumors. By bridging the gap 
between clinical and biological information, Rembrandt will facilitate 
the diagnosis and treatment of individual patients and will assist 
brain cancer researchers in their search for a cure.
  Mr. Speaker, I offer my warmest congratulations to Ms. Madhavan and 
her team.
