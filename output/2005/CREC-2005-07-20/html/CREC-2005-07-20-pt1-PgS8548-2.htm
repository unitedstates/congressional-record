 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES

<bullet> Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 
achievements of the California Association of Sanitation Agencies, and 
to celebrate the organization's 50th anniversary.
  CASA has provided the State of California with clean, safe, and 
reliable drinking water since its founding in 1955. Not only has CASA 
worked hard to ensure the well-being of Californians, but it has also 
championed a multitude of environmental issues related to clean water 
and water infrastructure that have been vital to California's long-term 
economic and social stability.
  I want to recognize CASA's proactive leadership in promoting 
partnerships with a variety of organizations to create a sound public 
health and environmental agenda. For the past 50 years CASA has been 
the voice of the public wastewater agencies and served to assist and 
monitor a variety of water quality, and related policy issues.
  CASA has fought hard on behalf of California's sanitation agencies 
and played an active role in numerous legislative struggles. Among 
CASA's legislative achievements include sponsoring legislation that 
gives publicly owned treatment works the authority to levy civil and 
administrative penalties against industrial dischargers for violations 
of local wastewater ordinances. Additionally, CASA has worked in 
partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to develop 
and implement effective water rules for air toxics, sewer overflows, 
and biosolids management.
  CASA has acted as a valuable resource by helping its member agencies 
understand and comply with varying

Federal and State water quality standards. CASA also has provided the 
legal, legislative, and administrative support for the publicly owned 
treatment work community and helped set the precedent for ensuring 
clean and safe water for all Californians. Over the years, I have come 
to value CASA's insight and suggestions for improving our Nation's 
water quality.
  Today I celebrate 50 years of CASA's devoted service and 
contributions to our Nation, and call upon CASA to continue to lead the 
way in its innovative and cooperative stewardship of our Nation's 
complex and growing waterways. Water quality is imperative to the 
development and welfare of my State and the Nation, and I thank CASA 
for its continued effort and contributions to the cause.<bullet>
