     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,

       Dear Mr. Speaker: This is to notify you formally, pursuant 
     to Rule VIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, 
     that I have been served with a grand jury subpoena, issued by 
     the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of 
     California, for documents and testimony.
       After consultation with counsel, I have determined that 
     compliance with the subpoena is consistent with the 
     precedents and privileges of the House.
           Sincerely,
                                                     Nancy Lifset,
     Legislative Director.
