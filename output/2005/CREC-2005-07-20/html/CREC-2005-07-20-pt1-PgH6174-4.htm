                     OPEN MARKET ACCESS WITH CAFTA

  (Mr. CHOCOLA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CHOCOLA. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of the United 
States-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement and the 
benefits it will provide to hard working farmers in Indiana and all 
across this country.
  Currently, the U.S. market is already fairly open to agricultural 
products from Central America and the Dominican Republic, but U.S. 
farmers face a variety of tariffs and other barriers when exporting to 
DR-CAFTA countries. This agreement will eliminate these barriers, 
reciprocate open market access, and put American farmers on a level 
playing field.
  More than half of America's agricultural exports will receive 
immediate duty-free access to DR-CAFTA countries under this agreement. 
This agreement will provide U.S. farmers with unequaled access to a 
large market with growing incomes and a growing demand for agricultural 
and food products.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support American 
farmers and support this very important piece of legislation.
