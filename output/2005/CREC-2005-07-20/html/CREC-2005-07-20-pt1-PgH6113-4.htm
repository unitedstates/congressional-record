                            SERVICE IN IRAQ

  (Mr. STRICKLAND asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, over the last few days I had the 
privilege of visiting in the home of John Bocerri. John Bocerri is a 
young Ohio State representative. He is the husband of Stacy, the father 
of two young daughters and just 3 days ago brought to his home from the 
hospital his third child, born 8 pounds, 8 ounces, young Matthew 
Bocerri.
  I was in that home as John gave that young infant into the arms of 
his young daughters for the very first time. John is a pilot in the Air 
Reserves flying out of the Youngstown Air Base. He flies the large C-
130 transport planes.
  On Thursday of this week, tomorrow morning, at 10 o'clock, John 
Bocerri leaves his wife, leaves his two daughters and his new infant 
son to go to Iraq for the fourth time. For the fourth time. John 
Bocerri represents the hundreds, yea, the thousands of young Americans 
who are serving this country with honor and distinction. It is sad that 
John Bocerri's children will pay for the cost of this war.
