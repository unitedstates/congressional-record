                          HON. ROBERT A. BRADY

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the lifelong 
service of Mr. Robert R. Mannings. Serving in the armed service during 
the Korean War, Mannings selflessly devoted his life to his country and 
was honorably discharged in 1953. Thereafter, Mr. Mannings began his 
exemplary career in Philadelphia in 1958 as an employee of both North 
Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and Yellow Cab Company. 
Subsequently, he joined the Iron Workers Local 401 and served as a 
journeyman worker until his retirement in 1992.
  As the president of the Dewey and Race Street Civic Organization for 
over 20 years, he improved the quality of his Philadelphia community 
and consequently was awarded the Philadelphia Most Beautiful Block 
award. Mannings' civic engagement extends to countless organizations 
including his active membership in the West Philadelphia New Life 
Development Association and the Mount Carmel Baptist Church for over 38 
years.
  A survivor of two bouts of severe cancer, Mannings loyalty to the 
American Cancer Society compelled him to create an educational video 
portraying the success of cancer survivors. This video is widely shown 
at medical conventions, in physician offices and seminars.
  Robert Mannings' devotion to his community never distracted him from 
his role as a loving husband to Frances E. Thomas, father of two 
children, grandfather of five, and great grandfather of seven. In 
recognition of Mr. Robert R. Mannings' years of service to the city of 
Philadelphia, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues rise 
to congratulate him on his retirement.
