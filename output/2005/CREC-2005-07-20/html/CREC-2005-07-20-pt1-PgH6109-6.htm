                   WELCOMING REVEREND KENNETH SAMUEL

  (Ms. McKINNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. McKINNEY. Mr. Speaker, Kenneth Samuel is a Godly man, and I thank 
him for being here today.
  He was born in Darlington, South Carolina, and received his B.A. from 
Wesleyan University, his Master's of Divinity from Emory University, 
and his Doctor of Ministry Degree from United Theological Seminary in 
Dayton, Ohio.
  Dr. Samuel was licensed as a minister and ordained at the historic 
Ebenezer Baptist Church of Atlanta, Georgia, the church of Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr.
  Reverend Samuel believes that the church must be all around us and is 
not just reflected in a building. Toward that end, he has taken his 
ministry of social justice to the community at large. Reverend Samuel 
currently serves as the President of the DeKalb County NAACP. He has 
also served as President of the DeKalb County Council on Adult Literacy 
and has volunteered as a chaplain at the DeKalb County jail. He serves 
on the Board of Leadership DeKalb and chaplained the southern region of 
the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.
  In 1987 he organized the Victory for the World Church and Independent 
Baptist Church and United Church of Christ. Reverend Samuel's church 
serves the total person, providing spiritual development, educational 
enhancement, and physical fitness. The church school, Victory Christian 
Academy, Victory Annex, and the Kenneth L. Samuel Community Life Center 
define Victory as a church that serves its members and the larger 
community.
  Reverend Samuel is a wonderful leader in our community, a strong man 
unafraid to take a stand, and I am proud to have him lead us in prayer 
today in our community, the United States Congress.
