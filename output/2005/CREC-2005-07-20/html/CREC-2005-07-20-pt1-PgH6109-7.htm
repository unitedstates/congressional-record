                          ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

  (Mr. POE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. POE. Mr. Speaker, the United States tracks cattle from where they 
are born as calves on ranches in Wyoming, Montana, and Texas to the 
slaughterhouses of the Midwest, to the butcher shops of the Northeast, 
to our supper tables where they end up as steaks. We have even tracked 
a mad cow born in Canada 3 years ago to some remote barn in Washington. 
We have not only tracked this mad cow, but all her calves in their 
different locations in the United States.
  Mr. Speaker, we know where the cattle are, but why is it that we can 
track one mad cow but the Federal Government cannot seem to locate 10 
to 14 million illegal people living in the United States, people who 
have invaded our land and disrespected our rule of

law. Someone has suggested that we give all people illegally coming 
across our borders a cow, and then let the Agricultural Department keep 
up with them and do the job the immigration people refuse to do.
  Our Federal Government needs to be just as concerned about the 
illegal people coming into the United States as we are about some sick 
cow coming from Canada.
  Mr. Speaker, this ought not to be.
