      THE 31ST BLACK ANNIVERSARY OF THE TURKISH INVASION OF CYPRUS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 31st 
Anniversary of the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus. First, I would like to 
acknowledge Representative Bilirakis and Representative Maloney for 
their efforts in bringing this issue to Congress.
  Today, as you well know marks the Anniversary of a day 31 years ago 
when the people of Cyprus's lives changed. In 1974, Turkish forces 
invaded Northern Cyprus and seized control of more than one-third of 
the Island. Cyprus has for the past 31 years been divided by a 113 mile 
barbed wire fence that runs across the island. Therefore, Greek 
Cypriotes are prohibited from visiting the towns and communities where 
their families have lived for generations. In 1983, illegal occupiers 
of the island declared the territory to be an independent state and 
called it the ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,'' a country which 
today remains shunned by the International Community and is not 
recognized by anyone besides Turkey. Currently there are over 35,000 
Turkish troops illegally stationed and it continues to be one of the 
most militarized areas in the world.
  I commend the United States Government, the European Union and the 
United Nations for encouraging a solution to the problem plaguing 
Cyprus. I sincerely hope that by taking a stance today, we can promote 
a renewed effort for direct negotiations and help the Greek Cypriotes 
get back what is rightfully theirs.
  I would like to express my support of the Greek Cypriotes who have 
been disenfranchised for generations and continue to be mistreated 
today.
