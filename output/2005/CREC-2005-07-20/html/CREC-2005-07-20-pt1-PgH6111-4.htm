     KARL ROVE'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE LEAKING OF CIA AGENT'S IDENTITY

  (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, whenever President Bush is asked to 
comment on Karl Rove's involvement in the leaking of a CIA agent's 
identity, the President says that he cannot comment because it is an 
ongoing investigation. However, if the President really wanted to know 
everything about Karl Rove's involvement, all he would have to do is 
call Karl Rove into the Oval Office and ask him. Rove's testimony 
before the grand jury was not private. Rove certainly could have 
explained his involvement so the President could then determine if Rove 
can be trusted as a senior national security advisor.
  There is simply no reason for President Bush to delay any longer. The 
American people and our CIA agents around the world need to be able to 
trust those with top security clearances.
  Two years ago, President Bush talked tough about this serious issue 
saying, if there is a leak out of my administration, I want to know who 
it is. Well, President Bush now knows Karl Rove was involved, and yet 
he says he wants to reserve judgment until after the investigation is 
completed.
  If the President really thought this was serious, he would call Rove 
into his office and demand an explanation. It is time for President 
Bush to hold Rove accountable for his actions.
