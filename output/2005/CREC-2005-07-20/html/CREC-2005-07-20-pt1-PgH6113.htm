                     EFFECTIVELY FIGHTING TERRORISM

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, though the two parties may disagree on aspects 
of the war in Iraq, I believe that terrorism is not a partisan issue. 
Yet minority party Members choose to align themselves solely with 
political rhetoric and hollow accusations. Instead of joining efforts 
to enhance America's security, Democrats continue to bring 
sensationalistic banter to this floor.
  Republicans are pushing legislation forward that will improve the 
effectiveness of and bring more accountability to U.S. foreign 
assistance around the world and bring democracy even further into the 
light. It is no secret that terrorist groups continue to recruit and 
train at a rapid pace. This legislation assists in cutting off the 
outlets and supplies of terrorist organizations and helps sever their 
operational channels. We are vigorously closing their doors.
  The foreign relations authorization addresses the pressing issues of 
our day such as U.N. reform, human rights and nuclear proliferation. 
This legislation authorizes assistance to America's allies and contains 
measures that continues breaking down elements of repressive foreign 
governments. As terrorists seek to debase the vision of peace and tear 
down hope, America will steadfastly provide a beacon of promise and 
allegiance.
