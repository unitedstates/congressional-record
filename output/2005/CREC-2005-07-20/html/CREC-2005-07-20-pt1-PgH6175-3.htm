                      REMEMBERING JAMES STOCKDALE

  (Mr. HUNTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for letting me 
follow the Top Gun, the gentleman from California (Mr. Cunningham), in 
giving our thoughts about Admiral Stockdale because Admiral Stockdale 
represented the very finest in American heroism. When he was going to 
be pulled in by the North Vietnamese to do a propaganda film he beat 
himself in the face with a stool that was in his little prison cell so 
that they could not use him.
  He shared for a while a prison cell with another great friend of 
ours, Sam Johnson, who was one of our wonderful POW heroes and is such 
a hero in this Chamber.
  I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Cunningham) for 
his great service, as a guy who flew into a pack of 28 MiGs to save his 
wing man and was nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor and 
received the Navy Cross because he was cut out of the same cloth as 
that great Admiral Stockdale.
  Our very best to the Stockdale family, to Sybil and the kids, and to 
every aviator who would follow that tradition of heroism and continue 
to keep our country safe.
