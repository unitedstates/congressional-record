                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness to 
note the recent passing of a dear friend and great American, Ben Ball 
of Morehead City, North Carolina.
  Born on October 14, 1956, Ben died too soon at the age of 48. Yet in 
those 48 years, he led a remarkable life.
  After attending Wake Forest University, Ben went on to graduate from 
East Carolina University and then began a successful 25-year career in 
the real estate business. He was a member of the Carteret County 
Association of Realtors where he was named Realtor of the Year in 1981, 
1992, and in 2002. The North Carolina Association of Realtors named him 
State Realtor of the Year in 2003, and he served as President of the 
North Carolina Association in 1992. From 1991 through this year he 
served as a State Director of the North Carolina Association of 
Realtors, and was active in the governmental and political process both 
in Raleigh and in Washington, DC.
  In addition to his professional activities, Ben was a pillar of his 
community. He was a lifetime member of First United Methodist Church in 
Morehead City, NC. He was a past President of the Rotary Club of 
Morehead City, and in 1997 was named Rotarian of the Year. 
Additionally, he had served for 5 years as Sponsorship Chairman of the 
Crystal Coast Habitat for Humanity Golf Tournament, served as Past 
President of the Carteret County Division of the American Heart 
Association, Past President of the Morehead City Planning Board, and as 
Past Chairman of the Carteret County Republican Party. Further, he was 
a volunteer at West Carteret High School, and assisted ``Toys for 
Tots'' for the past 5 years to help secure over 500 bicycles for local 
needy children.
  Mr. Speaker, I first met Ben many years ago, and knew him as a friend 
ever since. While Ben was prominent in the community, most 
importantly--like everyone else who first became acquainted with 
him through politics, or business, or through community activities--I 
came to know him not as a political friend, but just as a friend. 
Period.

  He was unfailing supportive, uplifting, and caring toward the many 
people in his life. His being here on this earth made a difference in 
ways that we all know, and--I am positive--in countless ways that we 
will never know.
  In times such as this, there are no words that can fill the void in 
the hearts of his friends and loved ones. While he is now in the loving 
arms of God, we who are still here miss him.
  Ben is survived by his wife, Debbie Carpenter Ball, by his sister 
Anne Roberts Ball, and by his daughters Debra Kreth Ball and Laura Ryan 
Ball. They are all in my thoughts and prayers.
