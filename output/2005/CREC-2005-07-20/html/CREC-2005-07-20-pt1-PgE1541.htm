   RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE POLISH SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT

                          HON. JOHN D. DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 18, 2005

  Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 25th 
anniversary of the Workers' Strikes in Poland. In commemorating these 
strikes, we are remembering the birth of a movement which led to the 
fall of communism in Poland and, later, Europe.
  The strikes began as workers across Poland protested the nearly 80% 
rise in meat prices. In the northern city of Gdansk, workers protested 
in response to the dismissal of two workers on the grounds of political 
agitation. The Lenin Shipyard workers staged a sit-in and demanded the 
reinstatement of electrician Lech Walesa and crane operator Anna 
Walentynowich. The workers realized the power of their unity and chose 
to name their strike bulletin Solidarnosc or Solidarity. Soon after, 
the first independent trade-union faction emerged and the Solidarity 
movement was born.
  In cooperation with intellectuals, the Gdansk Shipyard strikers 
created the famed list of 21 demands. The Solidarity Movement boasted 
members from almost all groups and social classes--all of whom opposed 
the Moscow-backed regime. This unity was a first in the history of 
Poland. In December of 1981 the Communist government of Poland 
implemented martial law in hopes of combating the Solidarity Movement's 
vast popularity.
  Despite the best efforts of the communist government, another strike 
wave occurred in 1988. The regime decided it must try to share its 
power with the opposition. The elections of June of 1989 brought the 
Solidarity Movement to power and Poland was able to set up a non-
communist government. The victory of the Poles served as an example to 
the rest of Europe and is credited with leading to the historic fall of 
the Berlin wall five months later.
  When the Solidarity Party took power in 1989, the basic political 
transition and the implementation of a market economy posed many 
challenges. Furthermore, they faced the daunting task of overcoming the 
social mind-set resulting from years of communist rule. Nonetheless, in 
January of 1990, the government sought to realize substantial reform 
goals. The conversion was not easy and the market-economy caused an 
economic crisis in 1992. However, true to their history, the Poles 
overcame this obstacle. We should all look to our great ally as a model 
of determination, resilience and loyalty.
  Over 11 million Americans claim Polish ancestry, nearly 900,000 of 
whom live in my home state of Michigan. Polish-Americans, like me, are 
proud of our heritage and Poland has shown itself to be a true ally of 
the U.S., most recently in Iraq. They have supported us in our struggle 
against global terrorism, in Afghanistan and assumed a leading role in 
Iraq. Two-hundred Polish troops are currently serving in Bagram, 
Afghanistan and our alliance with Poland remains one of our vital 
relationships. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in 
recognizing the 25th anniversary of a momentous event in the history of 
one of our strongest allies and greatest friends. The strikes in Poland 
will always be remembered for their important role in Polish 
democratization and, consequently, the end of the Cold War.
