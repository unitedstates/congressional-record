     PERMITTING USE OF ROTUNDA OF CAPITOL FOR A CEREMONY TO HONOR 
       CONSTANTINO BRUMIDI ON THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH

  Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the 
concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 202) permitting the use of the 
Rotunda of the Capitol for a ceremony to honor Constantino Brumidi on 
the 200th anniversary of his birth.
  The Clerk read as follows:

                            H. Con. Res. 202

       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
     concurring),  That the rotunda of the Capitol is authorized 
     to be used on July 26, 2005, for a ceremony to honor 
     Constantino Brumidi on the 200th anniversary of his birth. 
     Physical preparations for the ceremony shall be carried out 
     in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the 
     Capitol may prescribe.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Mica) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Millender-
McDonald) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica).
  Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House this morning in 
support of House Concurrent Resolution 202. This is a bill authorizing 
the use of the Rotunda of the United States Capitol for a ceremony on 
July 26 honoring Constantino Brumidi on the 200th anniversary of his 
birthday.
  On June 22, 2005, President Bush issued a proclamation which honored 
and celebrated the 200th anniversary of the birth of Constantino 
Brumidi. That is the action that brings us here today, to permit a 
ceremony in Constantino Brumidi's honor to be held in the Capitol 
Rotunda.
  Constantino Brumidi has been called the Michelangelo of the United 
States Capitol Building. House Concurrent Resolution 202 was introduced 
both to honor the life and also the work of Constantino Brumidi, who 
was an Italian immigrant also with strong family Hellenic roots who 
spent some 25 years, from 1855 to 1880, painting, decorating, and 
enhancing the beauty of our United States Capitol building. Brumidi was 
born in Italy in 1805 and he worked as an artist in Rome and the 
Vatican where he had many commissions, including a portrait of Pope 
Pius IX. In 1852, Brumidi immigrated to the United States and he 
dedicated the balance of his life to making our Capitol building one of 
the most impressive structures in this great Nation and really in the 
world.
  In 1865, Brumidi spent some 11 months walking dangerously high atop 
the Capitol Rotunda laboring on his masterpiece which if you go to the 
center of the Rotunda and look up, you see his famous work entitled 
``The Apotheosis of Washington,'' in the eye of the Capitol dome. Six 
years later, he created the first tribute to an African American in the 
Capitol when he placed the figure of Crispus Attucks at the center of 
the painting which memorializes and pays tribute to those patriots who 
were lost in the Boston Massacre.
  In 1878 at the age of 72 and in poor health, Brumidi began his final 
work and that was on the Rotunda frieze around the edge of the center 
of the Capitol dome. That frieze chronicles the history of the United 
States.
  Constantino Brumidi's life and work exemplifies the life of really 
millions of immigrants who came to the United States to seek 
opportunity and to seek freedom in America. Brumidi and many others who 
immigrated to the United States provided their skills and their hard 
work, and they bettered their lives and they bettered the lives of 
their children, their grandchildren, and their great grandchildren, 
many who serve in this Congress, many who serve across this land and 
whose daily lives enrich every day the United States of America.
  NAIF, the National Italian-American Foundation, is an organization 
which promotes American and Italian relations, cultural and business 
relations and numerous other U.S. Italian groups that support this 
effort to recognize the outstanding work of Constantino Brumidi.
  Constantino Brumidi is now part of the ages. He is deceased. However, 
his great artistic contributions all around us in this United States 
Capitol live on and give both beauty and also life, continuing life, to 
our Nation's Capitol building.
  Mr. Speaker, 2005 is the bicentennial of Brumidi's birth, and I can 
think of no better way to honor this patriotic Italian-American's 
contribution to our great Nation than by passing this resolution.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 
202 authorizing use of the Rotunda for a ceremony on July 26, 2005, to 
commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth
of a noted Italian-American artist, Constantino Brumidi.
  Brumidi was in many ways a classic American success story. Born in 
Rome to Italian and Greek parents in 1805, he began preparing for an 
artistic career at age 13 by studying with distinguished sculptors and 
painters. Much of his artistic vision was based on the wall paintings 
of ancient Rome and Pompeii, and on studies of the Renaissance and the 
Baroque. He focused on work for the Catholic Church, including several 
Popes, Italian princes, and other wealthy patrons.
  Forced to immigrate to the United States in 1852 from an Italy 
wracked by political turmoil, he became an American citizen in 1867 and 
established himself as a creator of historic frescoes and murals. 
Beginning in 1855 and lasting until his death in 1880, Brumidi is known 
today primarily for the murals he painted in a changing U.S. Capitol 
building over a 25-year period.
  His training was well suited in the classical design of the Capitol 
building. These works of art lure the eyes of visitors upward towards 
sights of beauty, in addition to the historic design of the Capitol 
itself, as they wander through examples of his artistry in the Capitol 
Rotunda, committee rooms, and what has become known as the Brumidi 
corridors on the first floor of the Senate wing of the building.
  Brumidi also accepted private commissions and periodically returned 
to his specialty of religious paintings for the Catholic Church which 
he had practiced extensively earlier in his career.
  Brumidi's worked on decorations in hallways and rooms throughout the 
Capitol and in the Hall of the House of

[[Page H6116]]

Representatives and in the Capitol dome, which symbolizes the center of 
American democracy. His murals combine classical and allegorical 
subjects with portraits and scenes from American history and tributes 
to American values and inventions. His work on the monumental canopy, 
called ``The Apotheosis of George Washington'' in the newly constructed 
dome remained incomplete at his death in 1880, but the dome frieze was 
ultimately concluded in 1953. Other artists continued to work on his 
unfinished projects.
  Brumidi's works are so admired that even in a constantly changing, 
crowded building where additional rooms for staff are created out of 
corridors which contain Brumidi's work, efforts are made to ensure that 
the walls and ceilings remain available to public viewing through 
transparent partitions.
  Mr. Speaker, Constantino Brumidi has deservedly been called ``the 
Michelangelo of the Capitol.'' His legacy was recently chronicled and 
evaluated in a richly detailed 1998 book by Dr. Barbara A. Wolanin, 
curator for the Architect of the Capitol and published by the U.S. 
Government Printing Office.
  It is fitting in another period of major change of the U.S. Capitol 
building with the anticipated completion of the U.S. Visitor Center in 
2007, we honor Brumidi's lasting contributions.
  I want to commend the sponsors of this concurrent resolution, the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bilirakis), the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) and the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) for taking this initiative as well as 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. Israel), who has sought a Presidential 
proclamation honoring Constantino Brumidi.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), who will relate some of the 
great Hellenic roots of Constantino Brumidi.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
Mica) for taking the lead on this issue.
  Mr. Speaker, I too rise today to support H. Con. Res. 202, a 
resolution permitting the use of the Capitol Rotunda for a ceremony to 
honor Constantino Brumidi on the 200th anniversary of his birth.
  To some Brumidi is known only as the artist of the Capitol. However, 
to many others he is much more. With his astonishing allegorical art 
work, Brumidi links the birthplace of democracy, ancient Greece, to the 
world's newest land of liberty, America. Moreover, Brumidi himself 
represents what his masterpieces convey. As a political refugee, 
Brumidi illustrates the principles upon which this great Nation was 
founded: Freedom, liberty and opportunity.
  On July 26, 1805, Constantino Brumidi was born in Rome to a Greek 
father and an Italian mother. He spent his childhood studying at the 
most prestigious art school in the city and quickly became a renowned 
artist, receiving a commission to work at the Vatican. He appeared to 
have a promising career ahead of him. However, due to political 
upheaval in Rome, Brumidi sought asylum in America, where he hoped to 
find independence and opportunity in a new land.
  On September 18, 1852, 59 years to the day when George Washington 
laid the cornerstone of the Capitol building, Brumidi landed in New 
York.

                              {time}  1100

  Because of his love of democracy, it would not take Brumidi long to 
fully embrace his newly adopted home. That November he filed paperwork 
to become an American citizen.
  Many of us have parents or grandparents who immigrated here from 
other countries, looking to escape oppression or to come to the land of 
opportunity to give their children a better life. Many of them 
succeeded in ways they never dreamed imaginable. Brumidi is one of 
those success stories. Who could imagine that an immigrant would be 
tasked with decorating the most significant building in the United 
States? I believe that it is a testament both to Brumidi's resolve and 
our great Nation's willingness to embrace those who want to share in 
the American Dream.
  Hundreds of thousands of people walk through these halls every year, 
but they do not expect to see masterpieces that parallel those in 
famous European museums and cathedrals. When they walk through the 
Rotunda, they do no expect to look to the ceiling and see the 
magnificent Apotheosis of George Washington and the great symbolism it 
portrays. But when they do, they look up and see Freedom, an armed 
woman trampling terrified despots. Brumidi perfectly intertwined 
American themes with his classical Greco-Roman artwork.
  Brumidi was not a soldier. He never lead an army against a tyrannical 
rule; but just as Francis Scott Key strikes a cord in our hearts when 
we hear the ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' Brumidi's legacy and 
contributions to democracy will live forever. I can think of no better 
place to commemorate the bicentennial of Brumidi's birth than in the 
Rotunda, under his most famous painting.
  Mr. Speaker, Brumidi once said, ``My one ambition and my daily prayer 
is that I may live long enough to make beautiful the Capitol of the one 
country on Earth in which there is liberty.''
  There is no doubt in my mind, Mr. Speaker, that Constantino Brumidi 
did just that.
  Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California 
for yielding me this time.
  Mr. Speaker, Brumidi is alleged to have said, ``My one ambition and 
my daily prayer is that I may live long enough to make beautiful the 
Capitol of the one country on Earth in which there is liberty.'' And to 
all of those who do come through this Capitol every day and see the 
beautiful artwork, this is what we will be honoring and recognizing 
next week.
  This Capitol and the beautiful artwork and sculpture that is in it 
was done by immigrants. Most of them did not make much money and most 
of them died poor. But they had a deep love for America, America. And 
Constantino Brumidi was no exception. He was exceptional.
  I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Ney) and the 
Committee on House Administration for bringing the resolution to the 
House floor. I also want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) 
for managing the resolution. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) has 
been the foremost leader in the Congress in promoting Brumidi's 
prolific life and his extraordinary legacy.
  It reminds me a bit of a sculptor, a famous Italian-American 
sculptor, Gaetano Federici, who came from Italy, and his sculpture 
exists all through the metropolitan area in New Jersey and New York. 
Similar backgrounds, came here not to accumulate a tremendous amount of 
wealth but to reflect their love of America, and they showed it and 
communicated it in their art. So it is a personal honor for me to lead 
the House of Representatives in remembering Brumidi with the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. Mica).
  The last time he was recognized in Congress was in 1980 at the 100th 
anniversary of his death. The late Congressman Peter Rodino, whom we 
eulogized just a few weeks ago at his passing, a great American, 
constituent, my friend, an inspiration, hosted the service. I know that 
Congressman Rodino is looking down on this ceremony today and will be 
here next week. Perhaps he is with George Washington in what Brumidi 
properly named in his most famous work, the Apotheosis of Washington. 
Twenty-five years later, I am humbled by the opportunity to continue a 
legacy that Congressman Rodino pursued with passion.
  Yesterday, I enjoyed a discussion with a roomful of Italian-American 
high school students from all across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, they 
traveled to Washington on a trip to explore the roles that people of 
their ethnic background play in the Federal Government. We discussed 
our grand Italian-American heritage. We discussed ways to advance its 
image. And when I fielded questions, one student asked, What is being 
done now to elevate the positive image of our ethnic community? I was 
happy to respond to this timely question. I told the students that 
today Congress would act to authorize a ceremony to honor Constantino 
Brumidi, the artist of the Capitol, an American

[[Page H6117]]

immigrant of both Italian and Greek descent.
  I explained that we live in a Nation of immigrants, that Brumidi is 
one of the greatest that we ever welcomed. He left Rome under 
unfortunate circumstances, having been imprisoned in the great fight in 
Italy for independence with both the Vatican and the state. Rome's loss 
was America's gain. When the French occupied Rome in 1849, Brumidi was 
accused by the Church of being a revolutionary. The work he had been 
doing in the Vatican came to an end. He set out for America where he 
hoped our free way of life would allow his talent to flourish. He 
arrived in New York City. Think of that day in 1852. He was a proud 
citizen 5 years later. Hear me, 5 years later. In fact, he was known to 
sign some of his work ``C. Brumidi Artist Citizen of the United 
States.'' How fitting.
  After traveling the country for work, in 1855 Brumidi's unique style 
found its way to the empty walls of the United States Capitol. He was 
commissioned by the Congress. Brumidi soon provided a unique ability to 
apply a classical style to create American themes. Though paid 
handsomely at the start of his career, Brumidi was not inspired by 
financial gain. After 2 years of work, he never got a raise. But his 
work continued.
  It continued in the Frieze of American History, in the Brumidi 
Corridor, in the Senate Appropriations Committee, in the reception room 
and in the President's Room, just to name a few. And on February 19, 
1880, exactly 25 years to the day after Brumidi began work at the 
Capitol, he died of a kidney failure. He died in poverty. And following 
his death, Brumidi's name and work slipped into obscurity. Much of his 
artwork was painted over, in fact. He was looked at as irrelevant. It 
was immaterial. It was not until 1952 that his grave site was 
recognized by the Congress, the Congress that he dedicated his life to 
physically enhance. It was not until 10 years ago that his work has 
truly begun to be restored.
  Brumidi was driven by enormous talent. He was driven by enormous 
patriotism. His passion allowed him to adorn the Capitol of his adopted 
country with the grand symbolism of a democratic Greco-Roman legacy.
  The event that this resolution will authorize takes a step to ensure 
that Americans will never forget one of our greatest historical 
figures. It will work to ensure that every American, Italian, Greek, or 
whatever, will recognize the name of Constantino Brumidi, one of the 
greatest immigrants to ever grace America.
  This is the 200th anniversary of his birth. This is the 150th 
anniversary of the beginning of his artistic career. And this is the 
125th anniversary of his death. It is only fitting that Congress honor 
Constantino Brumidi in this showplace, in the Capitol Rotunda, on the 
bicentennial of his birth.
  Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Israel).
  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this 
time and thank her for her leadership on this issue.
  I also want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) for his 
leadership, his passion for history, his leadership on behalf of the 
legacy of Constantino Brumidi in joining with me in urging the Stamp 
Advisory Commission to issue a United States postage stamp honoring 
Constantino Brumidi.
  Mr. Speaker, all Americans of all faiths, of all backgrounds, of all 
experiences who come to this citadel of democracy are inspired by the 
legacy of Constantino Brumidi. All of us are influenced by him. I was 
just walking through the corridors of the Capitol, and this is a very 
busy, very crowded place. And everyone who comes to the Capitol today 
and during these weeks has no choice but to look at the work of 
Constantino Brumidi, to be affected and influenced by it.
  Constantino Brumidi epitomizes the greatest democratic values that 
our country offers to the world: a sense of strength, a sense of pride, 
a sense of hope, the sense that one can come here with nothing and 
create an enduring and permanent legacy of their values.
  Constantino Brumidi captures not just the history that we view in his 
works in the Capitol, but he also sends us a critical message about our 
future, our collective future. What he tells us in his work is that 
this is a special place in the world, that one can come to America and 
work hard, they can reach the literal zenith of their profession, and 
in that workforce all the rest of us can look up at what they have 
done. That is something that should not be taken for granted.
  I would suggest that only in America could Constantino Brumidi's 
works be as cherished as they are. Only in America could his work force 
all the rest of us to look up at what he has done, and only in America 
could people from all faiths and backgrounds be so influenced and 
inspired by what he has done. That is the true lesson of Constantino 
Brumidi. He does not capture the past. He tells us that the best is yet 
to come.
  So I support this resolution. I thank the gentlewoman and gentleman 
from Florida, and I urge my colleagues to adopt it.
  Ms. MILLENDER-McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for 
time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  In closing, I do thank both sides of the aisle for participating in 
this, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) and the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. Millender-McDonald) for their leadership, and 
others.
  Rarely do we get to use the very center of the Capitol building, the 
Rotunda, in any ceremony. The Congress requires a joint resolution and 
that that resolution be considered by the other body for the purpose of 
honoring one of our citizens. So it is very rare. We paid tribute to 
Ronald Reagan. We have paid tribute to great Americans, Rosa Parks, in 
awarding the Congressional Gold Medal, leaders, political and social 
leaders.

                              {time}  1115

  How fitting it is that we take time as a Congress to recognize one of 
the artistic and cultural contributors to this great Capitol building 
on the 200th anniversary of Brumidi's birth. So we not only honor next 
week in this special ceremony Constantino Brumidi, but also all the 
sons and daughters of this great Nation, immigrants, who made not only 
this Capitol an incredible symbol of democracy and a beautiful place to 
work and visit and to have as our United States Capitol, but also to 
honor all those who have made this a great country.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the resolution.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Foley). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) that the House suspend 
the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 202.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds having voted in favor 
thereof) the rules were suspended and the concurrent resolution was 
agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                          ____________________
