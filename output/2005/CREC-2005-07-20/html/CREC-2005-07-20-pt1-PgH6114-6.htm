                         PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY

  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, point of privilege.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Foley). The gentleman may state an 
inquiry.
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to respond to the last 1-
minute. My request is that the words of the former speaker at the 
podium, to associate those of us who have been on the front lines of 
civil rights, both parties, both sides, with Ortega, this character in 
Central America, is the most ruthless thing I have heard in a long 
time. I have no association with that character. He belongs in jail, 
but simply because he has spoken on this, sir, do not associate me or 
anybody else with him.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated a parliamentary 
inquiry. Does the gentleman have a parliamentary inquiry?
  Mr. PASCRELL. Yes, I do.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may state his parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, my parliamentary inquiry is that we cannot 
just say anything that we wish to say on the floor of the House. I 
cannot, no one else can; and when you invoke the integrity of Members 
of this House who have spoken out, regardless of what position they 
take, I think that is something that needs to be looked at.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated a parliamentary 
inquiry.
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like the Chair to look into the 
words of the former speaker and see if any of his words should be taken 
down. I cannot be any more specific than that.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A demand that words be taken down as 
unparliamentary must be made at the time the remarks are uttered. The 
House has passed that point at this stage.
  Mr. PASCRELL. I rise for a point of personal privilege, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is unaware of any basis for a 
point of personal privilege at this stage.
