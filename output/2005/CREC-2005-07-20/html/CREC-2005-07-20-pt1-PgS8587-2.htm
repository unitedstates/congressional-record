                                PROGRAM

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, tomorrow, at approximately 10:30 a.m., 
the Senate will vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination 
of Thomas Dorr. This will be the first vote of the day. It is the 
majority leader's hope and expectation that cloture will be invoked on 
the nomination and the Senate can then expedite the vote on 
confirmation.
  Following the disposition of the Dorr nomination, the Senate will 
resume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
Chairman Warner and Senator Levin have been on the Senate floor this 
afternoon and have made real progress in disposing of a number of 
amendments. We anticipate a full day of debate and voting on amendments 
to the Defense bill. I encourage Senators to contact the bill managers 
if they have amendments they wish to have considered.
