                   IN REMEMBRANCE OF J.J. JAKE PICKLE

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                         HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 12, 2005

  Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Texas and our Nation has lost one 
of its most genuine and gracious public servants. Last Saturday 
morning, James Jarell Pickle, ``Jake,'' passed away on Saturday, with 
his wife by his side. For 31 years, Congressman Jake Pickle represented 
my hometown in this esteemed body as a Representative to the 10th 
Congressional District of Texas. And he did so with integrity, 
humility, honor, and a sense of humor that we should all attempt to 
mirror.
  As a current holder of Congressman Pickle's seat, I work hard every 
day to provide the same kind of service to my constituents that Jake 
Pickle did to those he served. He was not just good at what he did, he 
was the best.
  His family talks about the proudest vote he ever cast was in 1964 
when he voted for the Civil Rights Act. He was one of only six southern 
Representatives to vote for that important piece of legislation. In the 
1980s, he worked hours on end to protect Social Security and keep it 
solvent. He worked even harder in the 1990s to turn Austin into the 
high-tech society that it is today.
  It is because of Jake Pickle that Austin continues to see new high-
tech businesses locate to Texas's capital city. The University of Texas 
has also benefited greatly because of Jake Pickle. UT would not be 
churning out the latest in technology and new patents, as it now does 
every year, without the help that Congressman Pickle provided. It is 
also my honor to represent the research arm of the University of Texas 
which bears the name J.J. Pickle Research Campus.
  But even as good and as smart a politician as he was, he is known 
today not for his ability to influence legislation or to help bring new

business to his district, but rather for being a good and decent man. 
It is for this reason his nickname was Gentleman Jake. This gentleman 
served in the Navy during World War II, and worked his way through 
college by delivering milk to Austin homeowners. During his first 
congressional campaign and every time after when he was out in public, 
he was shaking the hands of those he served. He enjoyed hearing about 
their lives and telling stories about his. He listened to their 
problems and sometimes used his own money to fix whatever problems they 
were having.
  Representative Jake Pickle was a good man who will be terribly missed 
by all who knew him.
  So tonight as I stand in the well of this esteemed body, a place so 
loved and respected by Jake, I am comforted in the thought that the 
Lord above is thankful to have this great servant back home in heaven 
where I am sure he is telling stories and shaking the hands of everyone 
that he meets.
