                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Mr. Benjamin Mendoza, Sr., owner of Kelly's Body Shop in 
Santa Ana, California.
  Kelly's Body Shop was opened in 1978 by three separate owners but was 
then bought in 1994 by Mr. Mendoza who consolidated its ownership.
  Over the past 12 years, under Mr. Mendoza's ownership and strong 
management skills, Kelly's Body Shop has become one of the most 
successful businesses in Santa Ana, almost tripling its production and 
revenue in 2001.
  Mr. Mendoza considers it the mission of Kelly's Body Shop to provide 
quality, timely and satisfactory repairs and services to all of its 
customers and the people of Santa Ana, California.
  It is for these reasons that on June 15, 2005, the California Small 
Business Association awarded Mr. Mendoza a Small Business Award for his 
contribution and dedication to the city and people of Santa Ana.
  Kelly's Body Shop is an example of a successful business in 
California that continues to give back to its community. I believe that 
Mr. Benjamin Mendoza, Sr., will continue to expand his commitment to 
the communities he serves.
