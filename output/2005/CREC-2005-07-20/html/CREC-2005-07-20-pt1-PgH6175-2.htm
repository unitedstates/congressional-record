                    HONORING ADMIRAL JAMES STOCKDALE

  (Mr. CUNNINGHAM asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I support CAFTA but I am here talking 
about something both sides of the aisle can support. That is to honor 
Jim Stockdale.
  Admiral Stockdale is a true American hero. He died on July 5. He was 
a prisoner of war for 5\1/2\ years. He was so brutally beaten his 
shoulders were ripped out of their sockets. He was beaten by the 
Vietnamese so bad, almost senseless, that Jeremiah Denton had to take 
over his leadership of the camp at the Hanoi Hilton and of all POWs.
  He was then moved in with our Congressman Sam Johnson just to 
recover. It took him almost a year to do that. Admiral Stockdale and 
his wife, Sybil, who support our MIAs and our POWs we honor here in 
this body.
