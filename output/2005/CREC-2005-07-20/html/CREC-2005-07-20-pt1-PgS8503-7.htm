                                SCHEDULE

  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we will begin the Senate's session 
with a 60-minute period for morning business. Following morning 
business, we will return to the pending business of the Foreign 
Operations appropriations bill. We made substantial progress over the 
course of yesterday and last night, and although we were unable to 
finish the bill, the chairman was able to reach a consent limiting the 
number of amendments we will handle today. Many of those amendments may 
be worked out or perhaps not even offered. Therefore, we expect we can 
finish the Foreign Operations appropriations bill at an early hour 
today. We will have rollcall votes throughout the day until final 
passage of that measure.
  As a reminder to my colleagues, we filed a cloture motion on the Dorr 
nomination. That nomination is to be Under Secretary of Agriculture for 
Rural Development. That cloture vote will occur on Thursday morning.
  There are a number of other important issues we have mentioned over 
the course of the last couple days, including last night, that we will 
continue to work toward agreements on. I will keep all of our 
colleagues apprised as the schedule changes.

                          ____________________
