              A TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL MICHAEL L. HOLMES

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE McINTYRE

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. McINTYRE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding 
Naval Officer, Rear Admiral Michael L. Holmes. Admiral Holmes is a 
member of the Lumbee Indian Tribe and hails from Lumberton, North 
Carolina. After graduating from Pembroke State University in 1972, he 
was commissioned as a Naval Officer and designated a Naval Aviator. 
Admiral Holmes has served with distinction for nearly 32 years in the 
Navy, including several tours in command of operational forces and 
several important staff positions. Admiral Holmes is a person of 
tremendous talent, determined drive, and rich personality. His record 
of achievement is among the most remarkable on a long and distinguished 
list of military officers hailing from the Tar Heel State. He displays 
leadership that inspires others to give their all and puts them at ease 
as they strive to excel. He embodies the core values of honor, courage, 
and commitment. This great North Carolinian continues to bring great 
credit and honor to his native state, to his people, and to his family. 
As a nation, we are indeed honored by his long, faithful, and 
productive service to our country.
  Admiral Holmes will retire from the United States Navy on October 
1st, 2005. Mr. Speaker, Mike Holmes and his wife, Vee, have made many 
sacrifices during his long and illustrious career, and I offer a 
profound thanks to him from the citizens of North Carolina's Seventh 
Congressional District for his service. As they embark on the next 
great adventure beyond their beloved Navy, may God's strength, joy, and 
peace be with them both.
