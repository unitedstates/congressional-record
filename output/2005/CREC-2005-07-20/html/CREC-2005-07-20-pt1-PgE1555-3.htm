                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge the contributions of 
a very special church in Louisiana's 7th Congressional District.
  The Pleasant Green Baptist Church has been an important part of the 
Sulphur community and on July 31, 2005, Pleasant Green will be 
celebrating its 100th anniversary.
  The church's current leader, Rev. James Gatewood, is a dedicated 
servant. His success and the church's strong presence are directly 
attributable to the faith, generosity, and contributions of the 
congregation. The church

has been an important part of the moral fabric of Southwest Louisiana 
for 100 years and I am confident Pleasant Green Baptist Church will 
continue to be a valuable community member for many years to come.
  Today I want to recognize and congratulate the church and its 
congregation, for reaching this historic milestone.

                          ____________________
