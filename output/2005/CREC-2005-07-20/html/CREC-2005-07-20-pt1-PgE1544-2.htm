  Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, in 1979, a small group of health 
care professionals and lay volunteers in Elizabethtown began meeting to 
explore the idea of establishing a hospice in Hardin County. On April 
24, 1980, the Elizabethtown Area Hospice (EAH) served its first 
patient. The agency was staffed entirely by volunteers who provided 
care for patients and families living in and around Elizabethtown. In 
1986, EAR became fully certified by Medicaid and Medicare. The next 
year EAH changed its name to the Hospice of Central Kentucky (HCK) and 
expanded its services to include five counties: Hardin, LaRue, Grayson, 
Meade, and Breckinridge. In 1989, HCK also began offering its services 
to patients living in Marion and Washington counties. In the spring of 
1990, Taylor, Green and Adair counties became a part of HCK's service 
area.
  As the organization has grown and expanded its services, its base of 
operations has also changed. EHA was first headquartered in a small 
office in Hardin Memorial Hospital. Over the years, HCK has moved to 
different locations around Elizabethtown as the agency grew. After a 
successful capital campaign in 1993, HCK moved into its new main office 
building located on Diecks Drive in Elizabethtown. Since expanding its 
services to Taylor County in 1990, HCK has operated a satellite office 
in Campbellsville.
  A significant milestone in HCK's history occurred in 1996 when HCK 
joined with Hospice of Louisville to form the Alliance of Community 
Hospices, Inc. The following year HCK received its first certification 
from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.
  During its 25 years of existence, Hospice & Palliative Care has 
provided high-quality end-of-life care services to thousands of 
patients and their families living in the Central Kentucky area. In 
2004, HCK provided almost 30,000 patient days of care to 625 patients 
and their families. These services include pain and symptom control, 
medication management, personal care, emotional and spiritual support, 
volunteer assistance and bereavement care. In addition to providing 
core hospice services, HCK also employs a children's counselor to 
provide children and adolescents with specialized counseling and 
support. HCK also sponsors a grief camp, Camp Evergreen, for grieving 
children and their families.
  Licensed by the state of Kentucky, HCK accepts Medicare, Medicaid and 
many forms of private insurance. With the help of donations from the 
community, HCK provides care for seriously ill patients and their 
families living in the Central Kentucky area regardless of their 
ability to pay for services.
  While HCK has grown and changed in many ways over the years, one 
thing has always remained constant and that is the agency's commitment 
to providing the highest quality, most compassionate care possible to 
patients with terminal illnesses and their families. HCK dedicates its 
25th anniversary to its patients and families. Their courage and their 
faith, in the midst of illness and loss, is a source of inspiration to 
others.
