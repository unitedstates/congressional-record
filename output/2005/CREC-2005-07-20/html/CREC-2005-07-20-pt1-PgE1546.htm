                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. HENRY E. BROWN, JR.

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. BROWN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute 
to an extraordinary South Carolinian by congratulating the Honorable 
Robert W. ``Bobby'' Harrell, Jr. of Charleston on his recent election 
to Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives.
  Bobby Harrell was first elected to the South Carolina House of 
Representatives in 1992 and quickly earned the respect of his fellow 
members. Bobby is a man of diligence, integrity, and ability. In 1994, 
he was appointed to the Ways and Means Committee, where he served as 
chairman of the Economic Development Subcommittee and the Public 
Education Subcommittee. He was elected chairman of the full committee 
in 1999.
  Mr. Speaker, Bobby Harrell has always been a steadfast advocate for 
tax relief, educational opportunities, and economic development. As he 
begins his tenure as Speaker, I know he will continue to strive to 
assist all South Carolinians.
  Bobby has excelled in every endeavor he has pursued, and his private 
life is no exception. He is a devoted family man with deep convictions. 
Bobby is married to Cathy Smith Harrell and is the proud father of two 
fine children, Trey and Charlotte. He and his family are members of the 
First Baptist Church of Charleston, where Bobby served as a deacon for 
many years. He is a successful entrepreneur, recently celebrating a 
quarter of a century operating a State Farm Insurance Agency and Oak 
Haven of Charleston, an assisted-living community. Additionally, Bobby 
has served as a leader in many national, State, and local civic and 
business organizations.
  Mr. Speaker, Bobby Harrell is a good friend and I am proud to have 
the Speaker of the South Carolina House as a constituent. I ask my 
colleagues in the 109th Congress to join me in congratulating him on 
his recent election to Speaker and wishing him the best of luck in all 
his future endeavors.

                          ____________________
