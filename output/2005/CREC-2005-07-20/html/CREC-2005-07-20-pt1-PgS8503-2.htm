                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Spirit, who determines the steps of humanity, keep us in 
right paths. Deliver us from the detours of pride and anger that keep 
us from maximizing our possibilities. Guide our Senators through the 
labyrinth of tough decisions. Give them an ethical compass with which 
to navigate. Help them to seek You often for the guidance that will 
enable them to reach a safe destination. Give wisdom to our global 
leaders that they may live for Your honor.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
