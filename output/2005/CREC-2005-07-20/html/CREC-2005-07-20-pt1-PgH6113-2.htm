                                 CAFTA

  (Mr. PASCRELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I just heard a quote on the floor of the 
House of Representatives to send product to Central America or send 
troops. I have never heard anything more absurd or simplistic in my 9 
years here in the House of Representatives. The people of these six 
countries oppose CAFTA. They say it is unfair. And it really is a 
corporate-inspired trade deal that hurts working people both in the 
United States and Central America.
  Stop the hemorrhaging of American jobs. Protect American sovereignty. 
Put some backbone into both sides of the aisle on the independence of 
the legislative body. CAFTA is not only a spear into the heart of 
American independence but a heavy blow to the integrity of this House 
under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.
  Do we have the backbone to stand for the common good, the basis for 
the Judeo-Christian foundation of this Nation? Or do we just invoke 
these principles when convenient?
