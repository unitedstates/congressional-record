                      PASS A NATIONAL ENERGY BILL

  (Mr. STEARNS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, as the conference between the House and 
Senate on the energy bill gets underway, it is long past due for 
Congress to pass a comprehensive energy bill. U.S. economic prosperity 
is closely tied to the availability of a reliable and affordable supply 
of energy. As the economy grows, so will the demand for energy. 
According to the Energy Information Agency, the United States, by the 
year 2025, is expected to need 44 percent more petroleum, 38 percent 
more natural gas, 43 percent more coal, 54 percent more electricity, 
and 54 percent more renewable energy.
  Record increases in the prices at the pump and in overall energy cost 
underscore the long-term need to enact a comprehensive national energy 
strategy. So, Mr. Speaker, the time is now to do so.
