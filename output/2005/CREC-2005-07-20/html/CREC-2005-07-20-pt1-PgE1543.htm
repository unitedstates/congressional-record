 COMMENDING THE CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED 
                    STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                           HON. SHERROD BROWN

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 18, 2005

  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 
historic state visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. This 
visit comes at a time of ever-warming relations between the United 
States and India as these two great nations build partnerships in 
commerce, security, science, health, and technology. At a time of great 
global unease and change, our proud country has found a fast friend in 
India.
  In this chamber tomorrow, the Prime Minister will deliver a momentous 
address to our Joint Session of Congress. His presence in this house 
will send an unequivocal message to the government and the people of 
India. That message is that the United States stands in full support of 
the Indian commitment to democracy, peace, and prosperity. This address 
will show Indian and American citizens the significance of the enduring 
relationship between our two great nations.
  The United States and India have been partners in the birth of 
freedom, in 1776 and 1947, from which we grew to be the world's oldest 
and largest democracies. Let us now be partners in the war against 
terror as we fight for a more secure existence. Let us be partners in 
trade and economic growth that benefits all citizens. Let us be 
partners in scientific and technological advances that promote the 
collective well-being. Let us be partners in expanding access to first-
class health care and quality education. Let us be partners in our 
strong values, our commitment to our families, and our belief in 
humanity.
  Let the occasion of Prime Minister Singh's address also highlight the 
advances and contributions of Indian-Americans. The pioneers of this 
community first settled in California in the mid-1800s and worked as 
farmers. This tiny minority was not granted the right to American 
citizenship until 1947 and faced severe visa restrictions until 1965. 
From such humble beginnings, Indian-Americans have grown dramatically 
to a national population of 1.9 million. They are now the fastest 
growing Asian-American group in our great Nation. My district in Ohio 
is home to 2,480 Indian-Americans, who make vital contributions to our 
economy, culture, and society.
  Mr. Speaker, from my first visit to India in 1977 to having an 
Indian-American intern in my office every year since 1994, I have grown 
to appreciate and value the gifts of this nation to the world. I am 
thankful and proud to host Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the United 
States. I call on my colleagues to work tirelessly to strengthen our 
growing relationship and forge new ties with the great nation of India.
