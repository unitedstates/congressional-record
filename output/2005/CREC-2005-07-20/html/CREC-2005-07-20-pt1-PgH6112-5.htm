                          STATE DEFENSE FORCES

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the global war on 
terrorism continues, State Defense Forces are playing an increasingly 
critical role in ensuring that their communities are prepared for 
Homeland Security crises and recovery from hurricane damage.
  As a 31-year veteran of the South Carolina Army National Guard, I am 
well aware of the valuable contributions of the South Carolina State 
Guard. From training monthly to supporting National Guard operations, 
these capable men and women honorably offer their time and experience 
for their communities.
  To ensure that these volunteers are used to their greatest potential, 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Davis) and I have reintroduced the 
State Defense Forces Improvement Act. This legislation will recognize 
the importance of the State Defense Forces, authorize DOD and DHS to 
coordinate Homeland Security efforts with and provide training to State 
Defense Forces and allow State Defense Forces to receive surplus DOD 
equipment.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11.
