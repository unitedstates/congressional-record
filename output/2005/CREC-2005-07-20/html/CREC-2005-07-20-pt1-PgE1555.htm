        CONGRATULATIONS TO SPECIAL OLYMPICS ON 37TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. PATRICK J. KENNEDY

                            of rhode island

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. KENNEDY of Rhode Island. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to congratulate the Special Olympics on the celebration of 
their 37th anniversary. When the Special Olympics was founded in 1968, 
individuals with developmental disabilities were all too often 
separated from their families, as well as segregated from their 
communities. My aunt, Eunice Shriver, was able to see the potential of 
individuals with intellectual disabilities through her sister, and my 
Aunt, Rosemary. She was confident in her, and other disabled 
individuals', ability to participate in a meaningful way in their 
communities. By using sport as a vehicle and stage for demonstrating 
the dignity and capability of people with intellectual disabilities, 
Mrs. Shriver recognized the impact not only on the athletes themselves, 
but on the nation, as well. When the first International Special 
Olympic Games were held in 1968, 1,000 athletes participated from 26 
states and Canada. Today, the Special Olympics serves more than 1.73 
million athletes in 150 countries around the world.
  The Special Olympics goes far beyond serving the athletic needs of 
their participants, and has recently developed an initiative to provide 
much needed medical health services titled ``Healthy Athletes.'' 
Special Olympics ``Healthy Athletes'' improves access and health care 
for athletes at event-based health screenings, as well as makes 
referrals to local health practitioners when necessary. The data 
collected during these screenings also provides valuable information on 
the specific health needs of individuals with intellectual 
disabilities. In fact, data from the 2003 Summer games showed that 30 
percent of all athletes reported never having an eye exam and also 
referred 23 percent of athletes for follow-up by a physical therapist.
  The benefit of the Special Olympics to athletes, families, 
volunteers, and coaches cannot be adequately measured by statistics and 
numbers, but can be best represented by the recognition of the 
potential of individuals with intellectual disabilities by our society. 
Congratulations to the Special Olympics on 37 years of extraordinary 
service.
