              DR-CAFTA WILL BENEFIT BUSINESSES AND WORKERS

  (Mr. SHAW asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, this evening I rise in support of the United 
States-Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement. This 
important agreement will benefit the businesses and workers not only in 
my district but also throughout the rest of Florida and, yes, indeed, 
the rest of this Nation.
  The high tech companies located in and around my district will 
immediately benefit from the elimination of duties and other barriers 
to trade. In addition, DR-CAFTA will protect the copyrights and 
intellectual property of those companies, thereby helping to spur 
innovation.
  The liberalization of services under DR-CAFTA will make it easier for 
telecommunication, transportation, and computer service companies 
located in my district to explore new business opportunities in Central 
America and Dominican Republic. Further, increased trade between 
Florida and DR-CAFTA countries will lead to increased business for 
shippers and carriers moving goods in and out of the Ports of Palm 
Beach, the Everglades and Ft. Lauderdale and, yes, Port of Miami.
  If we vote to approve DR-CAFTA we ensure future American 
competitiveness in Central America, the Dominican Republic and the 
continued growth of our economy. This will benefit my constituents and 
all Americans. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this most important agreement.
