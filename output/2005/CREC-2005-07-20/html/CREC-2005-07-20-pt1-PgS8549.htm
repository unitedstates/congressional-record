                    HONORING CENTENNIAL HIGH SCHOOL

<bullet> Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend 
Centennial High School in Howard County, MD, for its fine performance 
on this year's ``It's Academic'' quiz show. After many hours of 
practice and four rounds of competition, Centennial has emerged as the 
2004-2005 Baltimore-area ``It's Academic'' champion.
  The team of Jeff Amoros, Michael Fasulo, Marin Lolic, and Seth 
Manoff, with the assistance of their coach John Cheek, took first place 
out of 81 teams that competed from both public and private schools 
across the State of Maryland. In its final match, Centennial defeated 
two formidable foes in Calvert Hall College High School and Oakland 
Mills High School.
  ``It's Academic'', which is telecast every Saturday morning during 
the school year on WJZ-TV, channel 13, has been quizzing Maryland 
students since 1961. In fact, according to the ``2005 Guinness Book of 
World Records'', it is the world's longest running quiz show. For 
Maryland students, ``It's Academic'' provides an opportunity to 
challenge not only their own knowledge of math, science, literature, 
government and history, but also how their knowledge stacks up against 
students around the State. This year, Centennial's team demonstrated 
enormous skill and erudition. Congratulations to Jeff, Michael, Marin, 
Seth and Coach Cheek on a wonderful accomplishment.<bullet>
