                                 PRAYER

  The Reverend Dr. Kenneth L. Samuel, Pastor, Victory Baptist Church, 
Stone Mountain, GA, offered the following prayer:
  Gracious and most loving God, today, as in days gone by, we 
acknowledge You as sovereign God; God of all people, all cultures, and 
all faith traditions. We pray that the differences which divide us will 
be mitigated and overcome by the common reverence that we share for 
You. Indeed, we pray that our communion with You will inspire and 
enable us to build a national and an international community where Your 
faith is reflected and recognized in the faces of all Your children, 
regardless of race, gender, religion, class, or sexual orientation. Let 
our communion with You enable us to build greater community with one 
another.
  On this day, make us Your servants indeed, and please allow our 
service to You to find expression in the respect and reconciliation 
that we seek to establish among all people.
  It is in Your manifold, marvelous, and matchless name that we offer 
this prayer. Amen.

                          ____________________
