                               KARL ROVE

  (Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because 
I just cannot help feeling remorse for what has happened to the truth 
in America.
  For more than a week, the American people have known that Karl Rove 
was involved in the leaking of a covert CIA agent's name to the press. 
He damaged our national security and put an agent at risk. This is not 
the work of a patriot.
  Of course, Rove did not admit to his treachery. Instead, the story 
has come out through reporters who are getting their information from 
Karl Rove's attorney.
  Republicans, from the President on down, continue to say that they 
will not comment until they know all the facts. Here is an idea: 
President Bush should demand that Karl Rove come clean and tell the 
American people everything.

  While Rove continues to hide behind his attorney, a grand jury is 
investigating the matter. For some strange reason, Republicans claim 
that Rove has been vindicated. Something tells me that if Rove really 
believed he was innocent of wrongdoing, we would have already heard 
from him by now.

                              {time}  1015

  The silence from both Rove and the White House is deafening, while 
the truth continues to be obscured for political gain.
