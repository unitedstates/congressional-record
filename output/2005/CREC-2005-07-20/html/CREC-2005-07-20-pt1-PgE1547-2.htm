     CONGRESSIONAL COMMENDATION FOR THE LIFE OF MRS. IRENE LOCKETT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CORRINE BROWN

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Ms. CORRINE BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this communication is 
forwarded on behalf of the constituents of Congressional District Three 
and myself as we pay tribute to the life of Irene Lockett.
  We are all deeply and profoundly saddened by the loss of this gentle 
and loving spirit. Irene was a true believer in God and family. She 
encouraged us to be our very best in all we do, at all times. 
Throughout her life, her loving spirit was unshakeable, her will 
undaunted, her stature in the church she loved and in the community she 
cherished remained strong and led Pat, her daughter, and my sister, to 
pledge her life to public service. She was the wife of Walter Lockett, 
mother of Pat Lockett-Felder, a member of the Jacksonville, Florida 
City Council, a grandmother, a great-grandmother and a Matriarch to 
all, family and friends alike. She absorbed our fears and our tears 
with her gentle embrace. When I think of Irene Lockett, I am reminded 
of the words of Paul in the Book of 2nd Timothy, ``For I am now ready 
to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a 
good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept my faith''.
  Though our hearts ache, our tears of pain are mixed with loving 
memories of her smile, her touch, and that gleam in her eyes telling 
each of us how much she loved us, even when words would not flow. She 
kept her promise--to love us, nurture us, guide us, and in her own way, 
she prepared us for this day. Weep not in mournful pain, shed tears of 
joy for Irene--no more pain, no more hurt--rest now in the arms of the 
Father who welcomes her home and whispers gently, ``well done my 
child''.
