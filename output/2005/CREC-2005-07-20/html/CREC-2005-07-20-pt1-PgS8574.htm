       (e) It is the sense of Congress that, as the United States 
     pursues a policy of moving forward on negotiations for 
     Kosovo's future status, the funds made available during 2006 
     under this heading for assistance for Kosovo should be used 
     primarily for programs that will promote progress on the 
     long-term fulfillment in Kosovo of the standards on human 
     rights, rule of law, democracy, and respect for minorities 
     that were established by the United Nations and that are 
     critical to promoting lasting stability and peace in Kosovo 
     and the surrounding region.

     SEC. 1205. THE UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY 
                   REVIEW COMMISSION.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) The 2004 Report to Congress of the United States-China 
     Economic and Security Review Commission states that--
       (A) China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) lack adequate 
     disclosure standards, which creates the potential for United 
     States investors to unwittingly contribute to enterprises 
     that are involved in activities harmful to United States 
     security interests;
       (B) United States influence and vital long-term interests 
     in Asia are being challenged by China's robust regional 
     economic engagement and diplomacy;
       (C) the assistance of China and North Korea to global 
     ballistic missile proliferation is extensive and ongoing;
       (D) China's transfers of technology and components for 
     weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems 
     to countries of concern, including countries that support 
     acts of international terrorism, has helped create a new tier 
     of countries with the capability to produce WMD and ballistic 
     missiles;
       (E) the removal of the European Union arms embargo against 
     China that is currently under consideration in the European 
     Union would accelerate weapons modernization and dramatically 
     enhance Chinese military capabilities;
       (F) China's recent actions toward Taiwan call into question 
     China's commitments to a peaceful resolution;
       (G) China is developing a leading-edge military with the 
     objective of intimidating Taiwan and deterring United States 
     involvement in the Strait, and China's qualitative and 
     quantitative military advancements have already resulted in a 
     dramatic shift in the cross-Strait military balance toward 
     China; and
       (H) China's growing energy needs are driving China into 
     bilateral arrangements that undermine multilateral efforts to 
     stabilize oil supplies and prices, and in some cases may 
     involve dangerous weapons transfers.
       (2) On March 14, 2005, the National People's Congress 
     approved a law that would authorize the use of force if 
     Taiwan formally declares independence.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--
       (1) Plan.--The President is strongly urged to take 
     immediate steps to establish a plan to implement the 
     recommendations contained in the 2004 Report to Congress of 
     the United States-China Economic and Security Review 
     Commission in order to correct the negative implications that 
     a number of current trends in United States-China relations 
     have for United States long-term economic and national 
     security interests.
       (2) Contents.--Such a plan should contain the following:
       (A) Actions to address China's policy of undervaluing its 
     currency, including--
       (i) encouraging China to provide for a substantial upward 
     revaluation of the Chinese yuan against the United States 
     dollar;
       (ii) allowing the yuan to float against a trade-weighted 
     basket of currencies; and
       (iii) concurrently encouraging United States trading 
     partners with similar interests to join in these efforts.
       (B) Actions to make better use of the World Trade 
     Organization (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism and 
     applicable United States trade laws to redress China's unfair 
     trade practices, including China's exchange rate 
     manipulation, denial of trading and distribution rights, lack 
     of intellectual property rights protection, objectionable 
     labor standards, subsidization of exports, and forced 
     technology transfers as a condition of doing business. The 
     United States Trade Representative should consult with our 
     trading partners regarding any trade dispute with China.
       (C) Actions to encourage United States diplomatic efforts 
     to identify and pursue initiatives to revitalize United 
     States engagement with China's Asian neighbors. The 
     initiatives should have a regional focus and complement 
     bilateral efforts. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
     forum (APEC) offers a ready mechanism for pursuit of such 
     initiatives.
       (D) Actions by the administration to hold China accountable 
     for proliferation of prohibited technologies and to secure 
     China's agreement to renew efforts to curtail North Korea's 
     commercial export of ballistic missiles.
       (E) Actions to encourage the creation of a new United 
     Nations framework for monitoring the proliferation of WMD and 
     their delivery systems in conformance with member nations' 
     obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the 
     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons 
     Convention. The new monitoring body should be delegated 
     authority to apply sanctions to countries violating these 
     treaties in a timely manner, or, alternatively, should be 
     required to report all violations in a timely manner to the 
     Security Council for discussion and sanctions.
       (F) Actions by the administration to conduct a fresh 
     assessment of the ``One China'' policy, given the changing 
     realities in China and Taiwan. This should include a review 
     of--
       (i) the policy's successes, failures, and continued 
     viability;
       (ii) whether changes may be needed in the way the United 
     States Government coordinates its defense assistance to 
     Taiwan, including the need for an enhanced operating 
     relationship between United States and Taiwan defense 
     officials and the establishment of a United States-Taiwan 
     hotline for dealing with crisis situations;

[[Page S8577]]

       (iii) how United States policy can better support Taiwan's 
     breaking out of the international economic isolation that 
     China seeks to impose on it and whether this issue should be 
     higher on the agenda in United States-China relations; and
       (iv) economic and trade policy measures that could help 
     ameliorate Taiwan's marginalization in the Asian regional 
     economy, including policy measures such as enhanced United 
     States-Taiwan bilateral trade arrangements that would include 
     protections for labor rights, the environment, and other 
     important United States interests.
       (G) Actions by the Secretaries of State and Energy to 
     consult with the International Energy Agency with the 
     objective of upgrading the current loose experience-sharing 
     arrangement, whereby China engages in some limited exchanges 
     with the organization, to a more structured arrangement 
     whereby China would be obligated to develop a meaningful 
     strategic oil reserve, and coordinate release of stocks in 
     supply-disruption crises or speculator-driven price spikes.
       (H) Actions by the administration to develop and publish a 
     coordinated, comprehensive national policy and strategy 
     designed to meet China's challenge to maintaining United 
     States scientific and technological leadership and 
     competitiveness in the same way the administration is 
     presently required to develop and publish a national security 
     strategy.
       (I) Actions to revise the law governing the Committee on 
     Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), including 
     expanding the definition of national security to include the 
     potential impact on national economic security as a criterion 
     to be reviewed, and transferring the chairmanship of CFIUS 
     from the Secretary of the Treasury to a more appropriate 
     executive branch agency.
       (J) Actions by the President and the Secretaries of State 
     and Defense to press strongly their European Union 
     counterparts to maintain the EU arms embargo on China.
       (K) Actions by the administration to restrict foreign 
     defense contractors, who sell sensitive military use 
     technology or weapons systems to China, from participating in 
     United States defense-related cooperative research, 
     development, and production programs. Actions by the 
     administration may be targeted to cover only those technology 
     areas involved in the transfer of military use technology or 
     weapons systems to China. The administration should provide a 
     comprehensive annual report to the appropriate committees of 
     Congress on the nature and scope of foreign military sales to 
     China, particularly sales by Russia and Israel.
       (L) Any additional actions outlined in the 2004 Report to 
     Congress of the United States-China Economic and Security 
     Review Commission that affect the economic or national 
     security of the United States.
