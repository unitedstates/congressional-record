                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mrs. MUSGRAVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the groups and 
individuals who made the Prairie Horizons Trail a reality for 
Southeastern Colorado. It has been an extremely long process, but the 
hard work has come to fruition with the official opening of the Prairie 
Horizons Trail. This trail is a part of the TransAmerica Bicycle Trail.
  This trail crosses the United States from Yorktown, VA to Astoria, OR 
and it passes through the beautiful Eastern Plains of Colorado's 4th 
Congressional District, with more than 100 miles of Highway 96.
  Eastern Colorado communities and counties have come together to work 
on a plan for the trail corridor in the region, which has been named 
the Prairie Horizons Trail.
  On July 1,2005 Joy Lujan with the National Parks Service and Janet 
Frederick, Executive Director for the Kiowa County Economic Development 
Foundation, were met in Sugar City, Ordway, Crowley, and Olney Springs 
by county commissioners, mayors and community activists as the Prairie 
Horizons trail was officially opened.
  Lujan and Frederick presented business owners with commemorative 
``Cyclists Welcome'' signs and spoke briefly about the new brochures 
about the trail.
  I am proud to represent Crowley County Commissioners Dwight Gardner 
and Matt Heimerich along with Sugar City Councilwoman Eleanor Neiffert, 
Ordway Mayor Nancy Moore, Wendy Pettit with the Colorado Department of 
Transportation, Crowley County School Superintendent John McCleary, 
Olney Springs Mayor Deb DeVore, and the many other citizens who 
assisted in making this project possible. This is a wonderful addition 
to the Eastern Plains and to the communities in which this trail 
passes. It is my great honor to recognize the opening of the Prairie 
Horizons Trail.
