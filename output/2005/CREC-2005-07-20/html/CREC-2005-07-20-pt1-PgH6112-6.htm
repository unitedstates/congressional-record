                      CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN IRAQ

  (Mr. KUCINICH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, today's New York Times states that a 
London-based group of academics and researchers has released a report 
on civilian casualties in Iraq for the first 2 years of the war. The 
report, based on analysis of civilian casualties reported in the news 
media, states that 24,865 civilians were killed and about 42,500 
wounded.
  The report goes on to list its findings specifically. We also know 
that there is another study which was published in October of 2004 in 
the Lancet, the British medical journal, according to the New York 
Times, that says that some of the estimates of Iraqi civilian deaths 
range as high as 100,000.
  I have stood on this floor many times and bemoaned the loss of our 
American troops, but I think in the name of humanity we have to start 
thinking

about the impact that this war is having on the civilians in Iraq. 
Their lives are being destroyed. Their families are being wiped out.
  House Joint Resolution 55 sets the stage for bringing our troops home 
and ending this tragedy in Iraq.
