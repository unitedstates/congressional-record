 COMMENDING THE CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED 
                    STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                             HON. TOM DeLAY

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 18, 2005

  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the United States Congress will 
welcome His Excellency Dr. Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of the 
Republic of India.
  His visit to the United States, and to this House in particular, is a 
symbol of the strong and vibrant relations between our two nations, the 
oldest and largest democracies on earth.
  But the relationship between the United States and India is more than 
symbolic.
  It is the natural alliance between democratic nations who value 
freedom, and will defend their people from tyranny and terror.
  Since the Indian people achieved their independence from the British 
crown in 1947, their nation has become an example of political freedom 
and stability in a region that desperately needs it.
  India's economy has become a global leader in trade, science, and 
health, and its education system annually produces some of the 
brightest and most innovative minds in the world.
  India has become a valued trading partner with the United States, and 
a trusted ally in the global war on terror.
  Internationally, the Indian people--together with Pakistan--in recent 
years have sought peaceful solutions to their differences, setting 
aside decades of open hostility.
  And here at home, Indian-Americans have enriched our national culture 
by introducing generations of Americans to the philosophical, 
religious, and social traditions of their homeland.
  My own district in the Houston region is home to tens of thousands of 
Indian-Americans, who have become an indelible part of our community in 
recent decades, a fact for which I and my fellow Texans are most 
grateful.
  I am proud to sponsor this resolution commending Prime Minister Singh 
and his nation, and welcoming him to address the House and Senate 
tomorrow.
