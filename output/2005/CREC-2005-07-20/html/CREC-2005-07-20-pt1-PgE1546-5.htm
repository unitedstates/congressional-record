                   SOUTH CAUCASUS OPEN RAIL LINK ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOE KNOLLENBERG

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 20, 2005

  Mr. KNOLLENBERG. Mr. Speaker, United States foreign policy toward the 
South Caucasus nations is one of fostering regional stability and 
enhanced cooperation. I rise today to bring attention to the great 
injustice in relations in this region.
  I speak today to stress my opposition and to move forward with 
legislation contesting the proposed railroad connecting Tbilisi, 
Georgia and Kars, Turkey. The proposed railroad would systematically 
bypass Armenia, and push them further into isolation.
  As we all know, Turkey and Armenia have their differences. Although 
it is counterproductive to list those differences, instead I want to 
highlight the fact that it goes against United States policy to be in a 
position that further advances the turmoil in this region, The proposed 
legislation would bar U.S. support and funding for a rail link 
connecting Georgia and Turkey, but which directly averts Armenia.
  Eight years ago, the former Turkish president and the former Georgian 
president meant to discuss the railroad that would ``open a third 
frontier crossing between the two countries,'' providing further 
commerce and economic opportunity for the South Caucasus region. Both 
countries would benefit immensely from this railroad.
  While I will always support commerce-based proposals that spawn 
economic development around the world, this proposal initiates commerce 
at the cost of another country's economic development. This is 
unacceptable.
  This railroad would cost between $400-$800 million to construct, 
while a perfectly workable and capable rail link already exists. It is 
evident to all that this new rail system is being proposed for the 
specific reason of diverting commerce around Armenia.
  The construction of the proposed railroad would be equivalent to the 
people of Ohio building a new bridge to Canada just to avoid traveling 
through Michigan. The United States government would never condone this 
action, and we should not be in the practice of condoning the actions 
set forth by the Turkish government.

  The existing rail would be available for use within weeks of an 
agreement between Armenia, Turkey, and Georgia. Furthermore, the 
Armenian people are willing to forego using the rail until normal 
relations with Turkey are established. Mr. Speaker, although normal 
relations may still take some time, there is no reason to further shut 
Armenia out of the equation.

  Moreover, the building of this railroad also highlights the ongoing 
struggle between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Known by all, Azerbaijan's 
main goal is to strangle Armenia into submission of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
This railroad does just that.
  The United States and other countries around the world, including 
Turkey, need to allow these two countries to agree upon a solution 
regarding Nagorno-Karabakh. It is necessary that third parties remain 
neutral. The proposed railroad not only stunts the diplomatic progress 
between Armenia, Turkey and Azerbaijan, it unnecessarily blocks 
Armenia's economic and political progress.
  I encourage my colleagues to look at the facts of this situation. The 
existing rail link would be available essentially as soon as possible 
and it would take a minimal amount of funding in order to get it usable 
again. Whereas, a new rail link would take months if not years to 
build, and would cost an estimated $400-$800 million. There should be 
no question as to which plan the United States supports.
