         DEMOCRATS SHOULD CARE MORE ABOUT POLICY THAN POLITICS

  (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, last week the minority leader told reporters 
that ``it is essential for us,'' meaning Democrats, ``to take down 
their numbers,'' meaning Republicans. And she went on to cite the 
reasons it is more important to tear down Republicans than offer an 
actual agenda.
  It is obvious from these statements that the Democrat leader's main 
strategy is obstruction and politics. They care more about partisan 
spin and negative attacks than ideas and progress.
  However, Republican policies are lowering the deficit created by 
recession and terrorist attacks. Republican policies have spurred the 
creation of a million jobs this year. Republican policies have allowed 
the economy to grow faster than any other industrialized country.
  And Republican leadership, as opposed to decades of Democrat 
complacency, have led us into the national discussion on the future of 
our most important retirement program, Social Security.
  The Democratic agenda has lost at the polls. If they cared more about 
working families than their poll numbers, maybe they would start 
winning elections again.
